San Francisco It has never been easy to have a rational conversation about the value of gold
lately with gold prices up more than 300percent over the last decade it is harder than ever
Wouldn’t you know it
since their articles appeared the price of gold has moved up still further Gold prices even hit a recordhigh dollar1300 recently
last December many gold bugs were arguing that the price was inevitably headed for dollar2000
now emboldened by continuing appreciation some are suggesting that gold could be headed even higher than that
since then the index has climbed above 10000
now that gold has crossed the magic dollar1000 barrier why can’t it increase tenfold too
admittedly getting to a much higher price for gold is not quite the leap of imagination that it seems
but January 1980 was arguably a freak peak during a period of heightened geopolitical instability
at dollar1300 today’s price is probably more than double very longterm inflationadjusted average gold prices
so what could justify another huge increase in gold prices from here
one answer of course is a complete collapse of the US dollar
and if you are really worried about that gold might indeed be the most reliable hedge
sure some might argue that inflationindexed bonds offer a better and more direct inflation hedge than gold
but gold bugs are right to worry about whether the government will honor its commitments under more extreme circumstances
even the United States abrogated indexation clauses in bond contracts during the Great Depression of the 1930’s
so it can happen anywhere
there is probably some slight truth and also a certain degree of irony to this argument
