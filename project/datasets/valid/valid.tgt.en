contents
the present report covers the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 2000
it mainly contains short descriptions of ongoing programmes and statistics of participation per region and per country
over the last number of years each of the programmes has designed and distributed specific information brochures
the Programme of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research UNITAR is available upon request and further details are accessible online wwwunitarorg
the restructuring period of UNITAR has been completed with success
consolidation and expansion have commenced
the three questions to be addressed in this brief introduction are what has been accomplished where does UNITAR now stand and what are the main challenges and issues ahead
accomplishments during the restructuring period
the various resolutions of the General Assembly and the recommendations made by the United Nations responsible bodies since 1993 have been followed up and implemented
the main issues are briefly reviewed below
the necessity of maintaining a balanced budget UNITAR is fully selffunded
no funding or subsidies are received from the regular budget of the United Nations
recurrent appeals of the General Assembly to all Governments for support have had limited impact thus far
the level of funds allocated to special purpose grants is satisfactory
all the resolutions of the General Assembly which UNITAR was in a position to follow up directly have been implemented
the credit for this goes primarily to the Executive Director and to his exemplary personal rigour and sense of direction
present situation of the Institute
a Because of its limited financial resources UNITAR had to design its programmes and establish processes aiming at achieving concrete objectives
C Flexibility implies no guarantee of job security for the staff
not only are the contracts shortterm in nature but they depend on the availability of funds
each contract can be terminated upon 30 days notice should funds not be available
responsibility for fundraising usually lies with the staff members themselves meaning that the regime is even more severe than in the private sector
each of the main programmes will be briefly described in the present report
statistical annexes should concretely illustrate the type and extent of UNITAR activities during the period under review
some 228 different programmes have been conducted over the five continents benefiting 11170 persons
the duration of the programmes varies from a couple of days to six months
the number of individual programmes and participants will certainly be in progressive decline in the years to come
the development of capacitybuilding projects will undoubtedly supersede workshops and seminars
cooperation with United Nations funds and programmes and specialized agencies has continued to develop
grants have been received from the United Nations Fund for International Partnerships and the Global Environment Facility GEF
the recommendation of the Joint Inspection Unit regarding division of labour has been strictly implemented
any research conducted by UNITAR or the United Nations Staff College should be operationally oriented and should enhance their training activities
challenges for the future
UNITAR is at the service of Member States
on the whole its restructuring process is generally considered to have had positive results achieved in a relatively short period of time
UNITAR also has the advantage of working towards specific and quantifiable objectives
at UNITAR roughly one half of the budget is dedicated to capacitybuilding and the second half to training
the results of these renewed calls remain quite modest and somewhat disappointing
for the fellowship programmes for instance the Institute receives 10 nominations for each place available
if this situation is to improve the General Fund made up of nonearmarked contributions must be strengthened
moreover since 1993 UNITAR has received no subsidies whatsoever from the regular budget of the United Nations
some comments have inferred that this could be interpreted as a possible double charge by the United Nations
the Board expressed the hope that the General Assembly would use more explicit language on this issue
the Committee requested that the discussions between the Secretariat and the Institute should continue until a solution was found in accordance with the General Assembly resolutions
UNITAR has now regained its credibility and the quality and relevance of its programmes are no longer disputed
training which aims at capacitybuilding and institutionbuilding will have a major role to play
multilateral cooperation in particular on the part of the United Nations should represent the cornerstone of this new architecture
UNITAR has found its place in the context of training and capacitybuilding for sustainable development
report of activities
training Programme in Multilateral Diplomacy and International Affairs Management
the Programme's training activities can be presented under the five subtitles set out below
diplomacy training and fellowships
training for the diplomatic communities in Geneva Nairobi and Vienna
these training courses address diplomats at four United Nations headquarters namely Geneva Nairobi New York and Vienna
training activities in Nairobi have been conducted since June 1999
they focus on general specific and technical aspects which are instrumental for diplomats in accomplishing their professional tasks in a multilateral setting
new York activities are reported separately
tailormade training
participants learn how to act more efficiently on the multilateral scene for the benefit of their countries or organizations
thus UNITAR enhances domestic capacities for development in the United Nations Member States
countries define their training needs and priorities to UNITAR which then develops a training curriculum on an individual basis
the Institute selects trainers and handles all administrative and logistical aspects of the programme
Lastly UNITAR carries out the training programme provides all trainees with background material and evaluates the success of the training project
such training can be implemented in Geneva at other United Nations headquarters or incountry sites
between July 1998 and June 2000 the following tailormade training was conducted for a total of 94 trainees
b Seminar on the United Nations system and its reform for government officers from the Gambia conducted in Banjul upon the request of UNDP in the Gambia
C Regional international law course for countries from Central Asia and the Middle East conducted in Tehran by UNITAR on behalf of the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs
Fellowship programmes
as a rule these training courses last much longer than the aforementioned training programmes covering periods of three weeks six weeks and seven months
they are recurrent annual programmes and participation is based on a competitive selection process
Fellowship Programme in International Law The Hague
a limited number of places is available for lawyers from industrialized countries on a costcovering basis
Fellowship Programme in International Affairs Management Geneva
this threeweek training programme introduces junior to midlevel diplomats to the multilateral diplomatic work environment
the fellowships are reserved for trainees from developing countries and countries in transition
interested diplomats from industrialized countries may also attend but must pay a course fee
Fellowship Programme on the International Civil Service Yaoundé Paris Geneva
this sevenmonth programme is open to trainees from the public and private sectors of Frenchspeaking developing countries
it is organized with the support of the Agence intergouvernementale de La Francophonie in collaboration with the Cameroon Institute of International Relations and the Parisbased International Institute of Public Administration
the training comprises four months of instruction followed by a threemonth practical internship within a United Nations organization or specialized agency
b Peacemaking and preventive diplomacy
programme for Briefing and Debriefing Special Representatives and Envoys of the SecretaryGeneral
this programme is designed to preserve and pass on the valuable lessons and experience of special and personal representatives and envoys of the SecretaryGeneral
based on indepth interviews with current and past special representatives of the SecretaryGeneral a wellorganized Handbook for special representatives of the SecretaryGeneral and envoys will be prepared
Fellowship Programme in Peacemaking and Preventive Diplomacy
the major focus is on the peaceful resolution of disputes through the United Nations
senior Seminar in Peacemaking and Preventive Diplomacy
the seminar examined lessons from Cambodia Bosnia Guatemala Mozambique and Tajikistan Participants were senior United Nations staff and senior scholars with expertise in this area
regional Training Programme to Enhance Conflict Prevention and Peacebuilding in Southern Africa
it is anticipated that this will become a yearly programme
a similar meeting is being planned for October 2000 with participants from all parts of Africa
the meeting will be held at the Gorée Institute in Senegal and is being funded by the Canadian International Development Agency and the German Federal Office of Foreign Affairs
Democratic Institutions and Conflict Management in West Africa A Strategic Workshop for Senior Policy makers
the meeting was geared towards senior government officials such as presidential advisers government ministers and other senior policy makers from five West African countries
the AllAfrica Conference on African Principles of Conflict Resolution and Reconciliation
followup activities are currently under way to create a network of associations and institutions to carry out implementation of the recommendations of the conference
training Programme to Enhance the Conflict Resolution and Peacebuilding Capacities of Minority and Indigenous Peoples Representatives
this new programme aims to provide advanced training to key representatives of minority and indigenous peoples in problemsolving approaches to negotiation
the second annual oneweek training course will take place regionally and plans are under way to hold it at the University for Peace in Costa Rica in December
C Programme of Training for the Application of Environmental Law
the Programme is carried out in partnership with UNEP and with the Commission on Environmental Law of the World Conservation Union and features cooperation with several other partner organizations
a series of environmental law training manuals containing material found in no other single source is being produced
since 1998 considerable progress has been made in carrying out all aspects of the Programme most notably the production of 10 English Language Phase I Courses of Correspondence Instruction
by mid2000 over 500 participants from 88 countries had followed these courses
a training programme related to implementation requirements for the Convention on Biological Diversity and the biosafety protocol is also under preparation
international migration policy
at the end of June 2000 the International Migration Policy Programme concluded two years of implementation
experts from Governments intergovernmental institutions relevant nongovernmental organizations and academia act as resource persons
shorter followup seminars and workshops on specific topics of priority concern are organized in the same regional settings
a key feature of the International Migration Policy Programme is its interagency character and the resulting multidisciplinary approach and interagency cooperation
the Programme's concept is seen as innovative practiceoriented and responding to a real need
followup seminars in the second half of 2000 and beyond are planned for southern Africa eastern Europe and central Asia and the Caucasus
two major migration policy conferences are also envisaged for the Mediterranean region and for Eastern Africa
E Programme of Correspondence Instruction in peacekeeping operations
in collaboration with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations this programme ensures that the content of the courses justly reflects accepted United Nations practices and policy
each of the eight courses offered covers a different aspect of peacekeeping
eleven courses are now in place all of which are available in English two in French three in Spanish and two in German
during the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 2000 the Programme processed 2197 enrolments in 13 selfpaced correspondence courses with students coming from 63 troopcontributing States
new York office
the UNITAR New York office was opened in October 1996 in accordance with various resolutions of the General Assembly and with a decision by the UNITAR Board of Trustees
the office also provides briefs on other UNITAR programmes conducted from its Geneva headquarters
some highlights of New York office activities
the main operational task of the New York office is the design and conduct of training programmes for permanent missions in New York
from July 1998 to June 2000 the office conducted some 51 training events an average of more than two events per month
in 1999 the Institute offered 26 courses an increase of 7 new courses over the 19 offered in 1998 and in 2000 it is offering 30 courses
increasingly the New York office receives direct requests from permanent missions for additional programmes
the office will continue this strategy of flexibility and diversity while at the same time consolidating the themes and curricula that have proven their relevance to the work of delegates
furthermore efforts to offer content hours and continuing education units to UNITAR programme participants were initiated in 2000
Special projects
together they review and debate matters related to peacekeeping share ideas and offer recommendations to decisionmaking bodies
the report and recommendations of the conference series are submitted to the SecretaryGeneral and to Member States
it is also published in book form
the most recent conference in this series entitled The Nexus between Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding Debriefing and Lessons Learned was held in November 1999

in order to achieve this goal the project will perform a needs assessment among these parties
furthermore the project aims to develop efficient and equitable strategies for delivering capacitybuilding activities
C Information society and development
Centre dInitiation aux Technologies de lInformation ICT Training Centre project
it was financially supported by the Infodev programme of the World Bank and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France
it can now be said that the objectives of the project have been achieved
during the project three public seminars were organized
the first session trained experts on Network and the two following sessions trained experts on Internet applications
by the end of the seminars a core group of trainers was ready to assume the responsibility for future training in an autonomous manner
indeed a fourth training session was organized without any help from external parties
the CDROM Internet au Sud is a reference library on Internet and all related issues
it includes texts books training courses laws treaties and software
the French version was published in January 2000
UNITAR has launched a bilingual version FrenchEnglish which will be published by the beginning of 2001
the project InfoCom Gabon consists of defining a national plan for the entry of Gabon into the information society
the first step involves the constitution of working groups by sector of activity
these groups then have to work on the elaboration of a strategy in their respective field of activity
a training seminar for webmasters took place in March
a seminar held in April offered the opportunity to compile an assessment report on communication
a web site on the project is now available and includes a description of the project as well as all documentation relating to it
a seminar is scheduled for October where all the sectoral strategies will be presented
the last step will consist of defining the global strategy to prepare the entry of Gabon into the information society

at the national level
these countries now have a common information tool useful in addressing crosscutting communication issues for different conventions desertification climate change biodiversity
in the framework of its restructuring the UNEP Infoterra Programme has requested UNITAR to develop national capacities in the field of environmental information systems
this cooperation will be managed within the EISI programme and will ensure the implementation of future actions at national level
at the subregional level
Northern and southern Africa have expressed similar interest
the Observatory of the Sahara and Sahel and ITU subregional seminars are scheduled to be held in the near future
at the regional level
foreign economic relations
in recent years the scope of the programme has been expanded to include private sector entrepreneurs in order to enhance a closer publicprivate cooperation
in the reporting period a total of 855 participants attended UNITAR workshops on foreign economic relations
training Programme in International Economic and Financial Relations for the Central Asian Republics and Azerbaijan
during the two years from July 1998 to June 2000 UNITAR conducted 12 training workshops in Central Asia and Azerbaijan
national workshops seek to provide a more specific training approach geared to match the specific training needs of public officials within a given country

training Programme in the Legal Aspects of Debt and Financial Management for SubSaharan Africa and Viet Nam
overview and Background
UNITAR conducted six regional workshops for Africa and one national workshop for Viet Nam in the period from 1 January to 30 June 2000
in addition relevant training and pedagogical materials will be developed and disseminated widely both in Africa and in Viet Nam
subSaharan Africa
in the reporting period UNITAR conducted 13 regional workshops benefiting 326 government officials from eastern western and southern African countries
the hallmark of this period has been the Institution's close collaboration with African regional training institutes
following a needs assessment conducted by UNITAR during the reporting period the Institute conducted two national workshops in Hanoi for the Government of Viet Nam
the results as reflected in the participant questionnaires have been extremely positive
future national training workshops and dissemination of training materials are planned in the coming months and years
main achievements
the main achievements of the programme in the last three years are set out below
cooperation on a costsharing basis with African regional partner institutes
UNITAR also plans on developing ties with other institutes and organizations involved in training and capacitybuilding for the African subregion
completion of a record number of training activities
for the period from January 1998 to December 2000 the programme will have completed 20 workshops in both subSaharan Africa 17 and Viet Nam 3
to a large extent this success is owing to the Institute's excellent relations with its African regional partner institutes
increased involvement of African experts
by way of example of the 50 resource persons who conducted workshops 35 were African nationals
African experts have also increasingly contributed to the publications of the programme
SouthSouth cooperation
UNITAR experience and work in different regions has also led to a certain SouthSouth collaboration
for example UNITAR has brought experts from central and eastern Europe to speak in Africa and from Africa to speak in Viet Nam
this has been assessed by the stakeholders as a very positive way of sharing experiences and best practices
cost savings in programme management
considerable cost savings have been achieved in this regard
development of a capacitybuilding concept
the next programme phase will see the development of these profiles in east west and southern Africa
development and dissemination of training materials and documents
in this regard libraries and documentation centres in Africa have been supplied with all documentation developed at UNITAR
the core text of the report has been drafted in as succinct a manner as possible
the following annexes aim to illustrate the main achievements
annex I Members of the Board of Trustees

General reflections on training capacitybuilding and the state of the United Nations Institute of Training and Research
in this context the Executive Director and the programme coordinators of UNITAR have put the present reflections on paper
it should be generic enough to retain the attention of nonspecialists and substantial enough to be of interest to training specialists
a nonbureaucratic approach to management
the UNITAR restructuring process is considered to have had positive results achieved in a relatively short period of time
UNITAR has the advantage of working towards specific and quantifiable objectives
its management is based on the three Ps model purpose process and people
the Institute's successful restructuring is very specific to it and cannot necessarily be replicated in other contexts
the relatively small size of UNITAR has facilitated the design and conduct of numerous activities with the programme coordinators being given broad scope for initiative
the decentralization of responsibilities led to decentralized management
the role and task of the leadership is more of guidance than of daily management
each programme coordinator and their colleagues face opportunities and challenges
they must however set realistic goals in order to maintain motivation and team spirit
participation consultation and open communication allow broad and effective decentralization
this implies that confidence and informality supersede close or permanent supervision
a hierarchy certainly remains and is sometimes asserted but in a new and totally different perspective
obviously the administrative and financial restructuring of UNITAR had to be achieved in conjunction with an indepth reflection on the best possible ways to implement the Institute's mandate
a common approach of sorts to training has been identified
the whole development of training and capacitybuilding activities has been based on projects
if the Institute's recent past can be considered a success the main reason is undoubtedly that it has delivered the goods
the projects have been implemented punctually and following their terms of reference
all stakeholders and partners have been kept informed in a direct and transparent manner
evaluations have been conducted and results disseminated
precise timely and professional delivery can thus be considered as one of the major characteristics of UNITAR programmes
a specific approach to training
training is not synonymous with education
indeed the two concepts are quite different
it would be interesting to go back to the roots of the terms and analyse them individually
Etymology can be useful in obtaining the sense of a term even if it has evolved from its original meaning
education in Latin educare from exducere means to bring up or more precisely to lead out
knowledge has become an individualistic and almost mystical concept of the improvement of the self
the rapid evolution of techniques and social transformations are leaving certain areas of competence obsolete at a rate unknown in the past
the interrelationship between education training and capacitybuilding is closeknit and complex
a sound basic education lays a good foundation for the assimilation of new skills following a training policy which encourages flexibility and imagination
in the modern climate of change a new mentality is imperative and institutional rigidity must be confronted
the practical solutions which had been successful in a less complex and more stable world must be revisited
this should lead to greater individual motivation and increased support from decision makers
good training can progressively counter the reluctance to change which precedes rapid evolution of society and technology
training is a precondition for professional integration which is for its part a prerequisite to sustainable development
indeed competencies are often more sought after than qualifications at least in highly industrialized countries
in the postindustrial society concrete professional experience and track records tend to be given as much emphasis as academic certificates
the number of students at universities has ceased to be an indicator of the quality of any society
the pitfalls of online training
to keep pace with these transformations new pedagogical methodologies must be introduced including distance learning and computerassisted teaching
as such these new technologies are not a cureall and would never fully replace the individual exchange between the trainees and the trainers
further to the recommendations of the General Assembly and following the guidance of the Board of Trustees UNITAR has ceased to conduct any research per se
the research activities which exist are geared to improve training in both its substance and methodology
a considerable amount of research was carried out during the period under review resulting in the publication of books and occasional papers guidance documents and training kits
UNITAR has of course also started the preparation and diffusion of electronic training material
these electronic materials are mainly training supports
UNITAR is considering the gradual introduction of online training parallel to its ongoing correspondence instruction courses
however thought must be given to both the content and the methodology
official validation by means of tests or exams must be put in place
at present there are very few convincing examples on the market
capacitybuilding a concept to be handled with care
the ultimate goal of staff training is institutionbuilding
the generic expression of capacitybuilding has become a catchword in recent years
as with many terms born of the politics of development assistance it coins a rather vague concept which could have many potential meanings
the term is sometimes used to denote an activity and is often found listed together with other actions such as training and education
more recently it has come to denote the need for a new approach to development cooperation
this new approach would be centred on the concept of strengthening national human and institutional capacity rather than direct technical assistance or traditional development cooperation methods
a much deeper reflection is needed
the imperative need for capacitybuilding is sometimes more obvious to donors than to recipients
the relevance and vigour of existing institutions must be evaluated and recognized case by case
in the absence of such an assessment limited new capacities may be built while many valuable existing capacities could well be destroyed
this concept is articulated around three main axes as follows
C UNITAR provides practical guidelines and expert support to the team which facilitates integrated approaches at both the national and regional levels
from the National Profile assessment of the infrastructure some salient features appear
UNITAR helps in organizing workshops for the setting of national priorities
since these priorities are often common mutatis mutandis to several countries thematic seminars can be held at the regional level
the concept of National Profile is relevant for capacitybuilding and institutionbuilding when several different governmental and nongovernmental parties are concerned
modest costs but insufficient means
the market of skills strengthening transfer of techniques and management improvement is highly competitive and often costly
this partly explains why reserves for training in public development assistance remain minuscule
the cost of training also derives from the complexity of contemporary issues
the development of any project implies the involvement of several professional trainers with different skills and knowhow
this means an active pedagogy which requires greater motivation and responsibility on the part of both instructors and trainees
through exchange and partnership countries can identify their own methods taking inspiration from the better practices of others
wellplaced investment in training activities is crucial to any strategy for sustainable development
looking ahead
in conclusion it may be useful to recall that within the new framework of international cooperation the importance of the training component in the development process has increased
requests from developing countries and countries with economies in transition are increasing
in its report on UNITAR the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions alluded to the proliferation of training programmes within the Organization
UNITAR avoids as far as possible the known weaknesses of capacitybuilding operations leaving the choice of priorities to the authorities concerned in each country
in being directly involved in the conceptualization and conduct of the programme the various stakeholders have some sense of ownership
generally the donors do not place any specific conditions on the conduct of the programmes
they usually request regular reports and occasionally carry out their own evaluation of the concrete impact of the operations and do not exert any direct control over the programme management
the programmes have been adapted to better answer the needs of the beneficiaries
programmes are developing in parallel to ongoing negotiations such as on chemicals waste and pollutants
new trends in debt and financial management including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative have been integrated into the curricula
these different undertakings have been briefly reported in the preceding pages

chronological list of training activities 1 July 1998 to 30 June 2000
for the sake of brevity every programme event is not mentioned or described in the core text of the report of activities
this chronological table aims at showing in a rather comprehensive way the scope of UNITAR training and capacitybuilding activities and its geographical extent
some programmes have been recently developed in other languages usually by means of simultaneous interpretation
to be consistent and coherent the programmes are listed in English and French only
mention is made if a translation was made partial or complete into Arabic Russian and Spanish

annex VI
publications and training material
UNITAR publications are thus either practiceoriented books or manuals and training materials
only publications written or directed by UNITAR staff are mentioned here together with genuine UNITAR training materials published by the various programmes
most of the publications are edited and distributed through commercial channels
this guarantees a good level of scientific credibility since it must meet marketbased competition but in turn and unfortunately makes the publications rather expensive

accordingly as I noted in my fourth report to the Council on the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo MONUC S2000888 para
it also describes the immediate reaction of the international community including the humanitarian agencies
according to the report over 760 civilians were killed and an estimated 1700 wounded
more than 4000 houses were partially damaged destroyed or made uninhabitable
sixtynine schools were shelled and other public buildings were badly damaged
medical facilities and the cathedral were also damaged during the shelling and 65000 residents were forced to flee the fighting and seek refuge in nearby forests
the report contains a number of recommendations primarily relating to the need for additional humanitarian assistance and rehabilitation
I have recommended the implementation to the agencies concerned accordingly
I should be grateful if you would have this letter and its annex circulated as a document of the Security Council
signed Kofi A Annan
annex
report of the interagency assessment mission to Kisangani Pursuant to Security Council resolution 1304 2000 paragraph 14
the terms of reference for the mission are set out in the appendix
the mission was accompanied to Kisangani by Lambert Gbossa International Labour Organization ILO and Alan Lindquist United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo MONUC
the work of the advance team to assess structural damage was halted and the remaining team member was evacuated
difficulties with flight clearances also delayed the New York team's arrival in Kisangani until 22 August
the current system for flight clearance involves submitting requests at least 48 hours in advance through the Commissaire général Chargé des affaires de la MONUC
the mission reorganized its plans and continued with its investigations
an assessment of structural damage was carried out but it requires expert followup to complete the financial costings
the information gathered and assessments made from those investigations have allowed the mission to conclude its preliminary analysis and recommendations
the preparation allowed the mission to focus its work once in the city and make optimal use of the time on the ground
as a result and despite the constraints the mission was able to form what it believes is an accurate description of the situation in Kisangani
summary
the Democratic Republic of the Congo is in the throes of a deepening crisis that has so far eluded all political and military attempts to solve it
decades of political and economic mismanagement have resulted in widespread poverty poor infrastructure and weak and ineffective governmental institutions
the paradox is that these negative development trends are occurring in a country that has immense natural resources
this situation is exacerbated by the direct consequences of a pernicious conflict that has been widely described as Africa's First World War
as a consequence the country's economy is marked by high unemployment shrinking production rampant inflation and monetary instability
the escalating public finance deficit is currently being met by increasing the already heavy foreign debt
the recent war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has involved seven neighbouring countries intensifying the country's already critical socioeconomic and political situation
observers suggest the current situation in the country may have serious repercussions on the stability of the entire central African region
the city of Kisangani is one of the worst casualties of the most complex war in Africa
as in the rest of the Democratic Republic of the Congo life expectancy is low and infant mortality rates are high
access to basic health and welfare services is markedly less than the regional average
infrastructure is crumbling and much of the country is cut off because of a lack of transport
preliminary results from recent household surveys in urban areas commissioned by the United Nations indicate poverty and vulnerability to be commonplace
this has led some observers to suspect that an underlying cause was control of the lucrative diamond industry
over 760 civilians were killed and an estimated 1700 wounded
more than 4000 houses were partially damaged destroyed or made uninhabitable
sixtynine schools were shelled and other public buildings were badly damaged
medical facilities and the cathedral were also damaged during the shelling and 65000 residents were forced to flee the fighting and seek refuge in nearby forests
the conflict has intensified the pressure on an already fragile and neglected infrastructure increasing the hardship faced by the population of Kisangani
the health centres already underequipped and underfunded have had to cope with the new influx of victims
landmines were also laid by retreating forces on the bridge and along major routes
beyond the physical damage the psychological trauma inflicted on the civilian population by the outbreak of hostilities in Kisangani was immeasurable
systematic violations of international humanitarian law and indiscriminate attacks on civilians have left residents highly traumatized
the international humanitarian community and its national counterparts mounted an emergency response in the city and surrounding areas
over 240 tons of relief supplies were airlifted from Kinshasa Goma and Lubumbashi by the United Nations and international nongovernmental organizations
food and nonfood relief items were distributed to the internally displaced persons and affected residents
Congolese medical specialists including surgeons were flown in from the capital to treat the large number of war wounded
however it is the uncertain security environment that remains the main obstacle preventing people from resettling into their communities
while humanitarian assistance saves lives and offers grounds for the introduction of confidencebuilding measures among communities these interventions are unsustainable
Kisangani offers an opportunity to undertake a series of quickimpact projects to rebuild people's traditional capacities and selfsufficiency in the affected communities
recommendations
the search for peace is not dependent on political negotiations alone
MONUC should continue to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance and help to create an environment conducive to the provision of rehabilitation support to waraffected communities
supplementary recommendations
a working group involving key agencies should be established at United Nations Headquarters in New York to support the work of the country team
the international donor community must increase the level of funding for humanitarian assistance as outlined in the consolidated appeals process
however in Kisangani and elsewhere in the Democratic Republic of the Congo it is imperative to help rebuild people's traditional capacities and selfsufficiency in the affected communities
such programmes should aim to wean the population from humanitarian aid and establish a sustainable base for rehabilitation generated at the local level
Kisangani would be viewed as the pilot phase that could then be replicated in other parts of the country andor region
major rehabilitation projects are needed to rebuild houses improve the power supply water systems and road and bridge infrastructure
rehabilitation of Kisangani's electricity supply is a priority which should be addressed as a part of a comprehensive reconstruction and rehabilitation plan
transport routes in the region need to be reopened to facilitate commercial trade and the economic regeneration of Kisangani and other isolated areas
the United Nations should monitor and facilitate trade along newly reopened transport routes
the United Nations must address the psychological dimension of this problem when implementing a reconstruction or rehabilitation programme
the context an overview of the crisis
the current crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo formerly Zaire has complex political and socioeconomic roots
several attempts have been made to end the war
after numerous meetings an agreement was signed at Lusaka on 10 July 1999
a number of highlevel diplomatic missions have been undertaken to try to maintain momentum for peace but they have made little headway
the ongoing armed conflict has prevented any efforts at economic stabilization and growth
purchasing power has fallen and unemployment is endemic
increasing numbers of the population are finding themselves economically marginalized
the international humanitarian community has access to only 40 per cent of the affected population
there has been a poor donor response to the 2000 United Nations consolidated appeal less than 25 per cent having been received to date
trade with Kinshasa has been interrupted and transport on the river is at present only by small boat and canoe
commerce is almost exclusively with Goma and Rwanda and by air as all other transport routes are blocked
where roads are open they are in such bad condition as to make transport by anything but bicycle nearly impossible
economically the city is almost totally isolated
the necessity of airlifting supplies into the city has resulted in a general increase in the price of goods with staples such as beans and rice more than doubling
Kisangani being a city that relied commercially on links with Kinshasa and river transport the economic repercussions of this isolation have been enormous
Sotexki a textile factory whose staff has fallen from 2500 to just 130 is a typical example of this
widespread unemployment increased prices and a decrease in purchasing power have all contributed to a general rise in poverty within the city
it is reported that they are increasingly turning to corruption as a way to make ends meet further exacerbating problems
administrative structures have broken down and taxes remain unpaid consequently there have been years of underinvestment in and neglect of local infrastructure
typical of this is the electrical supply which is estimated to be less than a third of total demand
of the three turbines of the city's hydroelectric power station two date back to 1955 and have been out of action since 1998
the third will stop functioning within 12 months unless spare parts can be obtained
without electricity the water pumping station will shut down leaving over 600000 people without reliable water supplies
a 1999 nutritional study by Médecins sans frontières Holland estimated that 91 per cent of children aged 5 and under were suffering from severe malnutrition
food security in the city has been a problem for some months mainly because the city has been cut off from the surrounding areas that traditionally supply it
the city's schools have also been funded through church groups for some years
the higher education facilities which include a university higher education colleges and a medical and law school are for all intents and purposes closed
a whole generation is at threat of growing up illiterate andor without formal education
the conflict of 510 June 2000
Kisangani has been the theatre of several clashes between rebel and government troops and between erstwhile allies according to some observers
in addition rivalry intensified as parties tried to gain credibility by being the controlling authority in one of the main provincial MONUC locations
another factor is the strategic position of Kisangani as an entrepôt at the nonnavigable rapids between the small river upstream and the large navigable river downstream
losses among the civilian population were high and damage to the city's infrastructure and housing was widespread
over 760 civilians were killed and an estimated 1700 wounded
over 4000 dwellings were damaged destroyed or made uninhabitable see table 1
sixtynine schools were partially destroyed or damaged see table 2 and other public buildings were badly affected
power stations and the watersupply systems were severely disrupted
the fighting forced some 65000 residents to flee Kisangani and seek refuge in the nearby forests
around 3000 internally displaced people were housed in a camp at Katele
table 1 Damage to housing during the war of 511 June 2000
table 2 Damage to schools during the war of 511 June 2000
tables prepared from information supplied by United Nations country team and nongovernmental organizations
beyond the physical damage the psychological trauma inflicted on the civilian population is immeasurable
during the Kisangani hostilities and throughout the war a hallmark of the crisis has been a blatant disregard for international human rights and humanitarian law
the war has been marked by gross violations of human rights the civilian populations being offered no protection and intentionally targeted by all sides through widespread atrocities
ordinary civilians in the city came to realize that they were in a highly vulnerable situation
on 5 June children were in school when fighting broke out
many were trapped for days inside school buildings only able to return home to safety during lulls in the shelling
several school premises were actually used by Ugandan and Rwandan armed forces to launch attacks and as fallback positions
this accounts for the high number of schools damaged during the sixday war
the humanitarian response
the humanitarian response in the aftermath of the Kisangani crisis was an example of good collaboration and coordination by both national and international bodies
local health personnel with limited means treated the growing number of injured and wounded
the International Committee of the Red Cross and Médecins sans frontières provided the necessary medical assistance to the war wounded within hours of the ceasefire on 11 June
the United Nations airlift between Kinshasa and Kisangani rapidly brought in stocks over 120 tons of emergency supplies equipment and fuel
rapid assessments of the internally displaced populations were carried out on all major axes connecting Kisangani with the rest of Orientale Province
emergency medical assistance and nonfood supplies were delivered to internally displaced persons in Kisangani and its environs and food aid was distributed inside the city
health centres were reopened and emergency medical services were organized on Kisangani road axes
comprehensive epidemiological surveillance mechanisms were established for the affected populations
surgical operations were carried out in the city hospitals of Kisangani with the help of Congolese surgeons brought from Kinshasa
landmines and unexploded ordnance are still a major impediment to the return of displaced people to their homes and to the resumption of daily life in the city
mines were laid in strategic military locations to prevent the advance of troops and protect retreating forces
around 18 mines were placed on the Tshopo bridge the major link in the city
reports indicate that some mines were laid after the ceasefire
beyond emergency response
an interagency plan of action was drawn up to systematically address the lifesaving requirements of the waraffected population of Kisangani for the first 100 days
the humanitarian community is currently planning activities that move beyond the emergency phase of the first 100 days
however with the humanitarian agencies working closely with civil society in the transition phase a more conducive environment should emerge
this phase of the war made residents realize the extent to which they were illprepared having no contingency supplies and powerless to prevent being targeted during the fighting
these feelings of vulnerability and humiliation continue to induce fear and panic in the population despite the demilitarization of the town
the international community's response to the hostilities in Kisangani helped to further strengthen links with civil society and local administration
these partnership arrangements and support to local initiatives are helping to improve social welfare and economic conditions for the population
close partnership must be developed with the international community to develop a wide range of projects to move beyond the current emergency phase
the existence of a strong civil society including a large number of national nongovernmental organizations is a characteristic feature of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
national nongovernmental organizations are present in Kisangani and in even the remotest parts of the country
this has been prompted in part by logistical constraints
WFP is currently exploring the possibilities of purchasing food supplies locally to reduce costs and stimulate the agricultural sector
a transitional mediumterm plan has been drawn up by the international agencies in collaboration with civil society and local authorities
this approach aims to embrace activities directed at alleviating physical suffering emergency food and medical assistance and protecting fundamental human rights
MONUC monitoring of the political and security situation in Kisangani and its environs is essential to determine the limits of operational modalities for agencies
appendix
terms of reference of the Kisangani evaluation mission
a meeting of concerned departments and agencies this afternoon has reached provisional agreement on the terms of reference of the Kisangani evaluation mission
these are focused primarily on paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution 1304 2000 and are as follows The mission should
make a preliminary assessment of the loss of life and property damage caused in the recent fighting
determine in close coordination with MONUC whether the United Nations should assist the population of Kisangani in other areas and if so how it should do so
propose measures in close coordination with MONUC to follow up the mission's visit
submit a report to the SecretaryGeneral with proposals for recommendations he might make to the Security Council pursuant to resolution 1304 2000
the mission leader Omar Bakhet will now conduct consultations to determine the membership of the team
participants in the meeting agreed that the expertise of their counterparts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo would be at his disposal
it is envisaged that the mission would visit the Democratic Republic of the Congo on or about 15 August and would submit its report by the end of August
the mission may also decide to visit Kigali and Kampala

note This paper is reproduced in the form in which it was received by the secretariat
it should be noted that the text of the Executive Summaries are subject to change before publication of the respective reports by OECD
background and tasks
this project on institutional aspects aimed to compare and assess the impact of different organisational structures on transport planning and intermodal policy development
the key focus was the government rather than the private sector
the project was not aimed at identifying and removing impediments to intermodal transport operations
these are properly matters for later work
definition of Intermodalism
intermodalism is not limited to the promotion of a modal shift from road transport to other modes
it also stands for the promotion of improvements in the transport chain without modal shift
for the purpose of this study a fairly general and broad definition has been chosen
intermodalism implies the use of at least two different modes of transport in an integrated manner in a doortodoor transport chain
modal approaches are necessary prerequisites but not sufficient
intermodal transport is hampered if the performance of any of the key transport modes is inadequate or if the linkages between modes are not efficient and reliable
many of the policy measures considered likely to promote intermodalism include but are not limited to modespecific actions
in most countries there is emphasis in the policy frameworks on promoting transport efficiency and facilitating modal reform
while the approaches to achieving transport efficiency improvements differ policy frameworks generally support competitive operating environments
different approaches can be taken depending on governmental involvement in transport ownershipprovision and transport operations
policy instruments
in countries with greater reliance on market forces use of such regulatory instruments by government is limited
communication between intermodal transport policy units and other actors
intermodal policy development requires cooperative arrangements between government and the private sector
performancebased outcomes
instead the approaches outlined provide a toolkit for countries when setting up intermodal arrangements or considering organisational structures for intermodal transport
the true value of intermodal approaches should be assessed in terms of performance on the ground rather than in terms of factors such as institutional arrangements alone
intermodal projects should be evaluated on a casebycase basis working with the private and public sector organisations involved
identification and removal of impediments
draft Final Report
background
a set of performance indicators
a major recommendation of this Group was to create a task force to conduct a coordinated set of field tests for selected performance indicators
the Task refined the indicators which were preselected and tested them over a period of two years
the field tests allowed the applicability of the performance indicators to be evaluated in order to determine their value in improving the management of road administration
the following 15 performance indicators PI were tested
average road user costs
level of satisfaction regarding travel time and its reliability and quality of road user information
protected road user risk
unprotected road user risk
environmental policyprogrammes
processes in place for market research and customer feedback
longterm programmes
allocation of resources to road infrastructure
quality managementaudit programmes
forecast values of road costs vs actual costs
overhead percentage
value of assets
roughness
State of road bridges
satisfaction with road system
this may entail developing common indicatorscriteria as well as a data information network and management system for OECD countries
this report provides a description of the approach adopted by the Group as well as a summary of the results from the field tests
approach
the main objectives of the Task Force were
generic vision for the road transport system
in general key issues facing the road transport system and road administrations are
demand for better results and quality Demand for more coordination and cooperation across transport sector
two roles have been identified within a road administration
one role is responsibility for the consequences of the road transport system for the whole society
the other role is the responsibility for road production roads bridges tunnels etc on an open and competitive market
the two roles of the road administration should therefore be recognised and described
in particular
road production together with the road administration for producing the required quality
independent responsibility for activities
it is very important to recognise the scope of responsibility of the road administration within the road transport system
some of the indicators used in this field test were partially outside of the area of responsibility of road administrations
much of the performance is dictated by policies set by government
another example is road user costs
the overall organisational structure of a country's transport sector has a significant influence on efficiency and the results of performance indicators
strong modal administrations within centralised ministries perform differently to administrations that deal with wider issues than road network management
selection of the performance indicators
a key component of the most successful road projects and programmes is a welldefined set of goals and objectives
however the use of performance indicators goes well beyond evaluating the degree to which goals and objectives have been achieved
the use of performance indicators by a road administration depends on the particular needs for development or improvement in performance
the main aspects that influence decisions on the use of performance indicators are
the 15 performance indicators selected for this project are not representative of the ideal or even the most important
they were selected by the Expert Group to cover the previously developed taxonomy
of the 15 performance indicators selected for the field test ten could be defined as exact measures with an associated absolute value
the other five were yesno indicators giving a qualitative measure of performance rather than exact values
additional data were required for further analysis particularly to give detailed explanations for the yes or no answers
the use to which performance indicators are put in different countries and road administrations was of primary importance to this field test
a comparison of actual indicator results revealed little information on the performance of a road administration
how to use the performance indicators
PI1 Average road user cost car and truck
PI2 Level of satisfaction regarding travel time reliability and quality of road user information
the elements that contribute to this indicator are in the majority of cases in the relatively early stages of development
even more experienced countries in this field are still in the learning process
at present the Satisfaction with the quality of information provided element fails to provide enough detailed information to set benchmarks and to implement an improvement strategy
it is therefore recommended that future work should follow the development of this type of measure and monitor its impact on future strategy and performance
this performance indicator could become a useful tool in measuring the performance of a road authority from the road users perspective
however with its current limited application it would be premature to recommend this performance indicator wholeheartedly
PI3 and PI4 Protected and unprotected road user risk
performance Indicators should be closely related to the products and services being measured in order to be efficient evaluation tools for management
fatality risk is not a suitable indicator for measuring the road safety performance of a road administration
more specific data are required for the development and implementation of effective road safety programmes and their evaluation
PI5 Environmental policyprogramme yesno
road administrations should have environmental policies and programmes aimed at achieving wider environmental objectives
the policyprogrammes should contain the characteristics described in the ISO 14001 standard
as defined the indicator does not give any information on the administration's concrete environmental targets
more exact and preferably measurable indicators need to be developed for a more results oriented and systematic approach
preferably these indicators should be verified at regular intervals
PI6 Processes in place for market research and customer feedback yesno
road administrations should continue to use market research as a planning and feedback echanism
more work should be done on this indicator to track the results of market research data and in particular whether the results make a difference
surveys should be phrased in a way to make the customers prioritise needs keeping cost as a factor
this is called a level of service decision
PI7 Longterm programmes for construction maintenance and operations yesno
the existence of a longterm programme should be considered an indicator of a wellmanaged organisation
the involvement of the public in its development and the identification of specific measurable performance objectives in the programme should be considered best practices for a longterm programme
the objectives for any road administration would be to get the approval for their multiyear programme from the highest political level eg the government
PI8 Allocation of resources to road infrastructure yesno
there are significant opportunities for improving resource allocation systems and procedures in road administrations
examples of systems and procedures are available to stimulate this process
PI9 Quality management audit programme yesno
quality management systems should be adopted as a means to develop the performance of road administrations
the establishment of such a system requires a major effort from the organisation but the effort is worthwhile
the complexity of the quality management system should be carefully examined
for quality management it is recommended that road administrations adopt ISO 90042000
however it does not detail the actual situation specifically the real performance of the road administration
in order to get more information on this issue the indicator needs further development
PI10 Forecast values of road costs versus the actual costs
administrations should strive to make the implementation of road projects more efficient
road administrations should use this indicator but it requires further analysis
it is not possible to recommend a best practice from the participating countries for this indicator
PI11 Overhead percentage
this indicator is useful in evaluating the costeffectiveness of the road administration
in addition international comparisons can be made if the same basis of comparison is used to establish the appropriate relative performance
the definition of components comprising this indicator requires further consideration
hence it is difficult to select the best practice among participating countries
each road administration is recommended to evaluate their own trends of overhead percentage within their country
the objective should be to lower constantly the overhead percentage in order to improve the effectiveness and the overall performance of the road administration
PI12 Value of assets
there are significant opportunities to use asset valuation to improve the systems and methods of road administrations
asset values provide significant information for government road agencies road users and taxpayers
an OECD Working Group is currently doing further work on this topic and more specifically on Asset Management Systems OECD forthcoming in 2001
PI13 Roughness
the responses clearly show that the measure of roughness as done in the field test does not allow useful comparisons to be made across countries
this situation leads to measures located nearly exclusively in the very good and good categories
the measure of roughness is a very useful performance indicator only if the reference tool is adapted to the development level of the country evaluated
a stricter thresholds matrix should therefore be used in developed countries to generate more precise data with the user's comfort as the objective
in developing countries the larger matrix is sufficient
in this case the final goal is to evaluate the level of mobility and user safety
besides this technical use roughness measures are especially relevant in a budget allocation process
PI14 State of road bridges
this indicator is recommended for all road administrations
it is more difficult to give any technical recommendations given the wide range of tools in use
no best practice is recommended for this indicator
however the detailed report provides useful information from different countries
PI15 Satisfaction with the road system
satisfaction with road system condition has been found to be a useful indicator with many applications
it is perhaps the best summary descriptor of the longterm performance of the road programme
it is most useful as a trend or series of annual summaries
the indicator is country specific but interregional state comparisons are possible
none of the responses indicated any direct connection between the road user satisfaction survey results and the programming process objective setting
no best practice can be recommended
conclusions and recommendations
the analysis of performance using key indicators provides road administrations with the basis to redefine activities
this was left for each participating road administration to implement
a key aspect of the project was the comparison of the processes where the indicators are used
a quantitative comparison between administrations has limited usefulness without a thorough examination of the underlying reasons for the differences
if numbers are compared the most relevant comparison is the trend within a single administration over time
it is inappropriate to define a common vision or common performance indicator target for all countries
each administration should define its own vision and determine best practices among other countries to realise that vision in the most effective way
in other words the report does not recommend defined visions to be adopted in any country
it is suggested to use the results as a framework for evaluating the role and performance of the road administration
customer focus has increasing importance in assessing a road administration's performance
it is critical to understand that there are different types of performance indicators and different ways to use them
this is important in selecting indicators for an administration
different indicators should be selected whether they are intended to improve
the internal efficiency of the road administration
the quality of the administration's products and services
the outcome to the road transport system
any particular process of a specific engineering task
the idea of a learning organisation was one of the driving forces in this work
the main innovation was that the renewal and innovation abilities of every road administration should be increased in order to actively improve an organisation's ability to change
benefits to participating administrations
there was consensus amongst participants in this fieldtest that their administrations benefited from the use of performance indicators
for others in particular the qualitative yesno indicators the definition was more difficult
however the exercise resulted in some innovative suggestions and points the way for improvements and continued use of these indicators
at the outset some doubts were expressed as to the applicability and usefulness of the qualitative indicators
a great deal of work is involved in defining indicators collecting and analysing the results and using the results to effect change
the participants in this field test are convinced that the outcomes are well worth the effort
recommendations for administrations wishing to embark on similar work
before starting the exercise the processes and management style of the administration should be defined
the areas for improvement or development should be specified and the performance indicators should be selected
it is a mistake to start collecting data on a number of indicators without understanding the underlying process or knowing what the information is going to be used for
draft Final Report
the road safety problem in OECD countries
approximately 125000 people die every year on the roads of OECD countries
this means that a road crash victim dies every four minutes
the real tragedy is that to a large degree these crashes and the resultant deaths and injuries are preventable
road safety visions targets and plans
a vision for road safety should be developed and incorporated into political and societal philosophy
it needs to be clear simple and easy to communicate
ownership of the vision by all stakeholders is a key to ensuring success in achieving road safety objectives
however in order to secure public ownership targets should be achievable within a realistic time frame
targets can be set by a topdown process based on idealism or through a bottomup process based on realism
normal practice is usually a combination of the topdown and bottomup approaches
the setting of targets has proven its value in many countries
road safety plans and programmes
action plans need to be comprehensive and focused on outcomes
the overall responsibility for traffic safety policy politically and technically should in principle be at the national level
multiannual programming of the actions supported by systematic public information and communication is mostly necessary
also the participation of the regional and local levels are important eg by allocating specific responsibilities at each level
in addition it is recommended that safety plans be developed at regional and local levels
the planning of measures can be based on existing knowledge regarding their effectiveness and efficiency
their contribution to the target fatality and injury reduction should be optimised through reduction of risk andor exposure
where the effects of new measures on the key indicators are unknown other indicators of effectiveness could be used behaviour knowledge organisational performance
experiments with innovative solutions can prove useful these projects have to be accompanied by actions of communications and thorough evaluation
the composition of the safety programme demands a ranking of possible safety measures
road safety budgets should be allocated to realise a maximum return to society
three socioeconomic tools are available to support resource allocation decisions costeffectiveness analysis multicriteria analysis and costbenefit analysis
theoretically social cost benefit analysis is the best tool to achieve optimal use of scarce resources
however cost benefit analysis requires extensive information that is not readily available and hence it is not often possible to use as the main criterion
research into increasing the applicability of cost benefit analysis is therefore strongly recommended
currently the allocation of budgets to road safety is based on political priority ranking of problems in society
funds are therefore often insufficient for financing all efficient projects
once the target is set costeffectiveness analysis or multicriteria analysis can be used to select the best set of measures to realise this objective
multicriteria analysis can be used for ranking measures even without quantitative data but does not guarantee economic efficiency
road safety measures
in view of the set targets an inventory should be made of possible safety measures directed at human behaviour vehicles roads and environment
national and regional differences in regulations for example driving hours vehicle standards licensing provisions should be taken into account
there is much agreement between countries regarding the main road safety problems
a wide variety of solutions have been put in place in OECD countries and further measures are being developed for implementation
however no country has implemented all proven measures to their full extent
further the realisation of expected benefits from the implementation of any measure will depend on the level of enforcement that goes with it
significant gains in road safety could be achieved if all proven measures were implemented and enforced in all countries
it is therefore not unreasonable to assume that all countries could achieve similar rates by fully implementing and enforcing known safety measures
political commitment is essential to ensure road safety is given a high priority
top officials therefore play a key role in championing road safety and ensuring it is placed high on the political agenda
the execution of this task should be monitored continuously
a balance between a completely integrated programme and innovative actions often initiated by the local level should be sought
all organisations with responsibility for aspects of road safety should therefore inform others and coordinate their activities
removal of institutional barriers by using an integrated road safety management approach should be considered
to achieve harmonisation in road safety programmes programme development should occur at both the national and regional levels
harmonisation between programmes at these levels is desirable
regional governments should therefore participate in the planning of national level programmes and the national government should take part in the planning of regional level programmes
while sound fatality data exist there are serious data deficiencies in many other areas
this is a key element of safety management to ensure that the best possible decisions are made
it is advisable that an independent agency with good research capabilities be put in charge of this monitoring and evaluation
expost evaluation of measures should be part of any road safety strategy
methods for forecasting and evaluating the results of road safety measures need to be developed in order to improve programmes or plan new programmes
they should be based on past traffic crash and incident data and analysis of information about nearcrash events
it is often difficult to find quantified evidence of the costeffectiveness of road safety measures
recommendations
the development of a vision and setting of targets has proven its value in many countries
raising public awareness and participation is crucial to the success of safety measures and gaining support for measures being implemented
they should participate in the development of the national road safety action plan including regional and local governments
responsibility should include both policy and technical assistance
regional and local road safety action plans should be developed and be derived from the national plan
the benefits from road safety measures should be quantified and ranked so that maximum returns are realised
there is much agreement between countries regarding the main road safety problems
a wide variety of solutions have been put in place in OECD countries and further measures and are being developed for implementation
further the realisation of expected benefits from the implementation of any measure depend on the level of enforcement that goes with it
the collection of relevant performance indicators eg behaviour data nearcollision data should be improved in order to facilitate the evaluation of safety measures

fiftyfifth session
agenda item 110
promotion and protection of the rights of children
protection of children affected by armed conflict
note by the SecretaryGeneral
protection of children affected by armed conflict
report of the Special Representative of the SecretaryGeneral for Children and Armed Conflict
contents
in 1999 the General Assembly extended the mandate of the Special Representative for another three years beginning in September 2000
the report therefore assesses overall progress achieved during the course of the initial threeyear mandate and sketches an agenda for action for the years ahead
apart from those addressed specifically to the Security Council those recommendations are for consideration and action by the General Assembly
his role as public advocate and moral voice on behalf of the millions of children affected by conflict has centred on
building greater awareness and mobilizing action
proposing initiatives and engaging key actors to protect waraffected children
promoting the application of international norms and traditional value systems that provide for the protection of children in times of conflict
proposing concrete initiatives to protect children in the midst of war and engaging parties to conflict to undertake specific commitments in that context
the activities of the Office of the Special Representative are funded entirely through voluntary contributions
impact of armed conflict on children
today in as many as 50 countries around the world children are suffering in the midst of armed conflict and its aftermath
at the present moment there are over 22million children who have been displaced by war within and outside their countries
increasingly children are specifically targeted recruited as combatants or abducted to serve as sexual slaves
the number of child combatants under the age of 18 is estimated at 300000
each month some 800 children are killed or maimed by landmines
these harrowing statistics cannot describe the damage done to individual children who have endured the horror of war
today's civil wars fought over power and resources are exploiting maiming and killing more children than ever
traditional authority figures and value systems which have buffered children and women from harm in the past are no longer respected
during fighting little distinction is made between civilians and combatants
the vast majority of victims up to 90 per cent are civilians mostly children and women
this is soldieroncivilian violence on an unprecedented scale
uprooted from their homes and communities children are left without adequate food shelter education and health care
crops schools health clinics and sanitation systems are degraded or destroyed fuelling high levels of malnutrition and disease
many children and their loved ones will fall victim to HIVAIDS which spreads especially rapidly in the corridors of conflict
although they are the least responsible for conflict children suffer disproportionately from its impact
international standards are violated with impunity
we must launch an era of applicationthe application of international and local norms for the protection of children in times of armed conflict
activities and initiatives undertaken in the past year
in the period from October 1999 to September 2000 the Special Representative has been pursuing the following initiatives and activities
international standards
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child
the agreement falls short of the straight 18 position that the Special Representative has advocated with respect to enlistment into national armed forces
to date 70 States have signed the Optional Protocol and three have ratified it Bangladesh Canada and Sri Lanka
international Criminal Court
at the suggestion of the Special Representative a steering committee was formed to inform participants in the Preparatory Commission for the Court about children's issues
as a result of these initiatives the Rules of Evidence and Procedure now include several important provisions designed to protect children
the Rules also enable the Prosecutor to record the questioning of a child especially in cases of sexual or gender violence so as to reduce any subsequent traumatization
African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child
the Special Representative urges the remaining African States to ratify this important instrument
Security Council
resolution 1314 2000 the second Security Council resolution devoted specifically to children and armed conflict was informed by the report of the SecretaryGeneral
the report itself which was called for in Security Council resolution 1261 1999 is the first ever to be submitted to the Council on the issue
it calls for the protection of particularly vulnerable children including internally displaced children girls and abducted children
the Council also calls for the strengthening of local capacities to protect children and greater participation of young persons in peacebuilding programmes
report of the SecretaryGeneral to the Security Council
in addition he held special consultations with UNICEF
C Regional organizations
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
they also decided to devote the OSCE Human Dimension Seminar for 2000 to the theme of children and armed conflict
the ChairpersoninOffice is working to ensure appropriate followup to these recommendations at the next meeting of the Ministerial Council in November 2000
Council of Europe
European Union
this builds on a considerable body of initiatives and activities developed on the issue of children and armed conflict by the European Commission
ACPEU framework of cooperation
in March 2000 the ACPEU Joint Assembly adopted a comprehensive resolution on child soldiers
Organization of African Unity
economic Community of West African States
Organization of American States
the Commonwealth
G8 industrialized countries
United Nations system
economic and Social Council
the report emphasized the significance of Security Council resolutions 1261 1999 1265 1999 and 1296 2000 on the protection of civilians
Commission on Human Rights
Working group on the Optional Protocol
Committee on the Rights of the Child
in short the advisers should prove to be an important new source of information linking the Committee with United Nations operations in the field
Department of Peacekeeping Operations
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
the Office of the Special Representative has maintained very active collaboration with the field presences of the Office of the High Commissioner in particular countries
the presence of child rights officers together with the senior child protection adviser has helped to ensure greater attention to children's rights within the context of the peace process
the field staff and presences of the Office of the High Commissioner have also supported the efforts of the Special Representative in Burundi
the Special Representative has recommended that the Office of the High Commissioner look into the development of strategies to ensure the systematic integration of children's rights within its activities
among specific activities that might be considered is the development of guidelines and monitoring manuals for the field offices and the special procedures
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
the Special Representative has continued to collaborate closely with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR in several areas
UNHCR contributed to the drafting of the terms of reference for child protection advisers with peacekeeping operations
he has sought to raise greater awareness of the need for systematic attention to refugee and internally displaced children
United Nations Children's Fund
the Special Representative has maintained a close working relationship with Francis Deng Representative of the SecretaryGeneral on internally displaced persons
the Special Representative's country visits and advocacy have helped to generate and focus greater attention on the plight of internally displaced children
Executive committees
E Placing protection of children on peaceagendas
neighbourhood initiatives
his efforts in the current reporting period have focused largely on West Africa
efforts in eastern Africa have also progressed while efforts in the Balkan region particularly the neighbourhood of Kosovo have not advanced in the course of this reporting period
West Africa neighbourhood
the Special Representative has sought to engage ECOWAS to address crossborder security issues in West Africa
the Child Protection Unit will serve as a special advisory unit to the ECOWAS Executive Secretariat and is expected to be operational early in 2001
the Unit will play a central role in coordinating national efforts and mechanisms for child protection including in countries not directly affected by war
Eastern Africa neighbourhood
the conference issued the Nairobi Declaration which proposed a number of regional cooperative measures to curb illegal arms flows
neighbourhood of Kosovo
during the reporting period the Special Representative sought to promote the neighbourhood initiative for Kosovo in the context of the Stability Pact for SouthEastern Europe
the renewed outbreak of conflict in Kosovo interrupted earlier plans for a mission by the Special Representative to the region but discussions on this have recently been renewed
country visits
it was his fourth visit to the country in two years
the Special Representative and Mr Axworthy were received by the President of Sierra Leone Ahmad Tejan Kabbah who updated them on developments in the peace process
President Kabbah informed the Special Representative of his decision to establish a National Commission for WarAffected Children in Sierra Leone
the Special Representative had urged the establishment of such a commission during his previous visits and welcomed this development
he also welcomed the willingness of donor Governments particularly Canada to provide financial support for the establishment and functioning of the Commission
the Special Representative has been working closely with the Government of Sierra Leone to put the structures in place for the establishment of the Commission
in Sierra Leone the Special Representative also visited waraffected children
during the war many children have been deliberately maimed with their limbs brutally cut off
thousands of children have been abducted forced to kill and sexually abused
the Special Representative made the following observations during this visit to Sierra Leone
a Security and disarmament
there was a common perception that the prospects for conducting elections by next February were bleak if basic security arrangements could not be established
b The diamond factor
Sierra Leone civil society had gradually become involved in the campaign to raise international awareness on this issue
C Marginalization of youth
many Sierra Leoneans expressed their concern about the growing alienation among young people who feel used discouraged and abandoned
many in this group suffer from illiteracy and unemployment and are becoming victims of drug abuse
there is much bitterness and anger within the youth population
d The special problem of amputees
many of the same people the Special Representative had met during his earlier visit in September 1999 were still in residence at the Murray Town amputee camp this year
such programmes should take particular care to foster the health selfrespect and dignity of child victims
visit of the Office of the Special Representative
the workshop produced a set of recommendations regarding the structure role and objectives of the National Commission and the procedures for its formal establishment
the participants concluded that the Commission should be formally established early in 2001 and that its principal objectives should be
to advocate for and facilitate the implementation of international norms and standards on the rights of children and act as an ombudsman for children
to ensure access to basic services particularly in the areas of health education and social welfare for waraffected children
to facilitate the increased participation of young people in the peacebuilding and democratic processes
to develop strong linkages with other institutions eg the proposed ECOWAS child protection unit
Northern Ireland
he met with some 30 local nongovernmental organizations involved in the promotion and protection of children's rights in Northern Ireland
he visited several Nationalist and Unionist communities in Belfast including Ardoyne New Lodge and the Shankill Road
he visited two partner schools involved in the programme St Theresa's Catholic and Elmgrove Protestant
a Sustained and concerted attention to children is needed throughout the consolidation of peace
b A new body is needed to consolidate the focus on children's rights in Northern Ireland
C Remove children from paramilitary activity and address issues of community security
d Support the capacity of families and teachers to protect children
family stability and support help mediate the impact of violence on children
parents have an essential role to play in dispelling myths about others and fomenting a culture of respect for diversity
educators and other members of civil society working to encourage crosscommunity links need to be given adequate and sustained support
E Bring lessons learned elsewhere to bear on behalf of children in Northern Ireland
F Ensure youth participation in the consolidation of peace in Northern Ireland
he strongly encouraged youth participation in the building and consolidation of peace in Northern Ireland
East and West Timor
onsite visits were conducted to refugee camps in West Timor
this relatively large influx placed particular strain on the local population which in certain communities has been outnumbered by refugees
some 126000 remain in refugee camps or local communities in West Timor
registration of the refugee population remains incomplete but United Nations agencies estimate that the majority of the population is made up of women and children
there have been reports of violence and intimidation in the camps
the explosive violence that followed the referendum destroyed the basic health and education infrastructure of East Timor
UNICEF estimates that some 90 per cent of schools were destroyed or badly damaged
in addition there is a shortage of human resources including teachers at the secondary school and higher education levels and health care providers
local and international groups in East Timor are debating how best to protect children who have been separated from their families or orphaned
a consortium of international nongovernmental organizations reports a significant number of children experiencing psychosocial problems as a result of their exposure to the violence
adolescents who have lost access to schooling also face a high unemployment rate and rising living costs
gangs and crimes are reportedly on the rise among young people
impressive efforts have been made to protect children during the emergency and the ensuing reconstruction phases in East Timor
these recommendations include
the establishment of a national commission for children
the placement of a senior child protection adviser within UNTAET
the integration of childrelated provisions into legislation and policymaking
the provision of child rights training for United Nations peacekeeping personnel
awarenessbuilding concerning child rights among the general population
programmes to address psychosocial trauma
local capacitybuilding
early rehabilitation of basic services and the development of radio programming for children
Colombia

on 27 December 1999 he congratulated the Government of Colombia for discharging the final contingent of 950 soldiers under the age of 18
on 5 May the Special Representative called on FARC to take verifiable concrete action towards demobilizing those children
H Outreach to women's organizations
women constitute a powerful force for peace and the protection of children during and after armed conflict
in March the Special Representative spoke to the Women's Caucus for Gender Justice
in May he addressed the annual meeting of the Sierra Leone Women's Movement for Peace
he gave the keynote address at the annual Voices of Courage awards of the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children
the Special Representative via satellite link addressed the Women as Partners for Peace Conference held at Kigali in June 2000
nongovernmental organizations
nongovernmental organizations play an indispensable role in shaping the agenda for children affected by armed conflict
he commends their Portrait Pledge for internally displaced children which was presented to the SecretaryGeneral in New York in July 2000
J Opinion makers
he also addressed the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders
media
media outreach is a crucial part of the Special Representative's advocacy work
during the past year he contributed opinion pieces to several influential newspapers including the Washington Post the Los Angeles Times the Globe and Mail and El Tiempo
he also took part in programmes as diverse as Foreign Correspondent ABC Australia The National Magazine CBC Canada and Human Rights Human Wrongs BBC 2 United Kingdom
he also served as a panellist at the New York screening of the HBO film Children in War
in addition he took part in a special edition of David Gergen's World at Large programme on United States public television
he was also interviewed by networks including National Public Radio United States Radio France Internationale Radio Japan NHK Radio Netherlands and the Voice of America
developing the web site
the site benefited from a new graphic design structural improvements and streamed videoaudio content
the address is wwwunorgchildrenconflict
progress achieved during the firstmandate
advocacy and engagement on the issue has increased dramatically
children are now more central to the peace and security agenda
war crimes against children have been prosecuted and violations are now being documented and reported more systematically
international standards have been strengthened
children are actively involved in building peace
humanitarian assistance is increasingly focusing on meeting the rights and needs of waraffected children
warring parties have made concrete commitments to respecting children's rights and international humanitarian law
however while significant progress has been achieved action to protect children must be deepened and intensified
placing waraffected children high on the international political agenda
Security Council
the Special Representative has made it a priority to make the protection of children affected by armed conflict a major issue on the agenda of the Security Council
over the course of the first mandate this has translated into a number of concrete outcomes
August 1999 Second open debate on children and armed conflict and adoption of resolution 1261 1999
July 2000 The SecretaryGeneral submitted to the Security Council the first report devoted to children and armed conflict
July 2000 Third open debate on children and armed conflict
the Special Representative also briefed the Council on several occasions after his visits to particular countries
regional organizations
incorporating children's rights into an international cooperation agreement
gaining the support of Governments
a number of Governments have responded to the Special Representative's call to make the protection of children a prominent feature of their domestic and international policy agenda
they have applied their influence to advance the issues within multilateral and regional forums
major international conferences
the symposium was the first to bring together a broad group of actors on the issue
the International Conference on WarAffected Children was hosted by the Government of Canada at Winnipeg in September 2000
the Agenda for Action adopted by the ministerial meeting and other records of the proceedings were handed over to the Special Representative
the Special Representative has held discussions with UNICEF on the preparatory process and the special session itself
the Special Representative was invited by the General Assembly to participate in the preparatory process as well as in the special session
in May 2000 the Special Representative addressed the session of the Preparatory Committee on emerging issues
he proposed that the special session should produce a plan of action with specific benchmarks for the distinct issue of children and armed conflict
the Special Representative will continue to spearhead the process of shaping the agenda on the issue of children and armed conflict
media outreach
in 1999 for example there were 63 articles in leading newspapers and magazines 31 television interviews 39 radio interviews and 32 press briefings
integrating the protection and rights of children into peace processes and peace operations
placing child protection on peace agendas
although children suffer disproportionately in times of war they have been absent from peace agendas
the Special Representative has strongly advocated for the inclusion of child protection concerns in peace agendas and peace accords
to achieve this goal the Special Representative has held consultations with mediators and parties in conflict and made specific proposals
incorporating child protection into peacekeeping mandates
peacekeeping missions have a critical role to play in providing protection to children
the Special Representative has successfully advocated for the protection of children to be systematically incorporated into peacekeeping mandates
child protection advisers
this proposal was accepted by the Security Council in 1999 and the terms of reference were completed the same year
the first advisers were deployed at the beginning of 2000 to Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo
the Security Council reaffirmed in resolution 1314 2000 its readiness to include child protection advisers in future missions
training of peace operation personnel
including children and armed conflict in regular reports to the Security Council
C Countryspecific initiatives
country visits
since the inception of the mandate the Special Representative has conducted 17 country visits 7 of which have been followup visits
obtaining commitments from parties to conflict
during the first mandate 36 commitments were obtained 9 of which have been fully met
on most occasions this was the first time that the parties to conflict had given any undertaking to observe humanitarian and human rights standards
a full description of the commitments obtained by the Special Representative is provided in his most recent report to the Commission on Human Rights ECN4200071
developing local initiatives
these include National Commission for WarAffected Children in Sierra Leone the first institution of its kind
parliamentary Caucus for Children in Sierra Leone
eminent Persons Group in Liberia composed of elders educators business persons advocates religious and civil society leaders
Sudanese Women for Peace a nonpartisan grassroots peace initiative
children as a Zone of Peace in Sri Lanka
new law in Rwanda allowing girls to inherit property
making children a central concern in postconflict response
E Strengthening and developing international norms to protect children
during the course of the first mandate the Special Representative made it a priority to strengthen standards and norms to protect waraffected children
they are The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court adopted July 1998 classifies war crimes against children and women
the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Antipersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction which entered into force in March 1999
it was adopted in June 1999 and is expected to enter into force in November 2000
launching an era of application for norms
this proposal was adopted by the Senior Management Group chaired by the SecretaryGeneral
the Special Representative has advocated persistently for the implementation of international instruments that protect waraffected children
g Reasserting traditional values and norms
his advocacy has succeeded in making this issue an important aspect of international discourse on child protection
H Countering impunity
the General Assembly Security Council and the Commission on Human Rights have each echoed his call for an end to impunity for such crimes
engaging and collaborating with nongovernmental organizations
the Special Representative has made it a priority to engage and collaborate closely with nongovernmental organizations for the benefit of children affected by armed conflict
the overall progress achieved to date in carrying out the mandate is due in great part to their tireless work
looking ahead building a movement for the protection of children affected by conflict
continued engagement of the Security Council
the Special Representative will work to ensure adequate followup to Security Council resolutions 1261 1999 and 1314 2000
he will take concrete steps to ensure implementation of the targeted measures specified in resolution 1314 2000
regional organizations
placing child protection on peace agendas
children's rights and the protection of children have been included in recent peace agendas in several countries
incorporating child protection into peacekeeping mandates
concrete steps have been taken recently by the United Nations to systematically incorporate child protection concerns into peacekeeping mandates
postconflict peacebuilding for children
this issue must become a priority
enhancing compliance by parties to conflict with obligations and commitments
he will advocate for concerted and targeted action by the international community against those that fail to adhere to international norms and standards
curbing child soldiering on the ground
now that the Optional Protocol has been adopted the Special Representative urges the international community to turn its energy to curbing childsoldiering on the ground
eliminating impunity for crimes against children
war crimes against children must be punished those responsible must be held accountable and brought to justice
monitoring and controlling illicit trade in natural resources that fuel conflicts
the link between illegal trade in natural resources and prolonged conflict has now been firmly established
similarly he will continue to urge the private sector to develop and adopt voluntary codes of conduct regarding such illicit trade
the Special Representative is working with nongovernmental organizations and youth groups to mount a vigorous campaign against conflict diamonds
signing and ratifying the Optional Protocol and the Rome Statute
we must work to ensure that the latter comes into force by the end of May 2001 which will be one year after its adoption by the General Assembly
facilitating local capacities for advocacy
the Special Representative believes that the international community must do far more in this area
promoting and strengthening local values and norms
throughout history societies have recognized the fundamental obligation to protect children from harm even in times of conflict
however prolonged conflict undermines and often shatters the values that hold a society together
these taboos and injunctions need to be reasserted
providing training for peacekeeping personnel
this is an issue that requires priority action
developing the research agenda to fill knowledge gaps
serious gaps in knowledge can constrain international efforts on behalf of children affected by armed conflict
engaging civil society
the Special Representative will build on his earlier work and intensify outreach to and engagement with communities of faith and women's organizations
reaching out to and involving young people
the Special Representative will continue to develop several initiatives including the Voice of Children project and the childrentochildren networks
voice of Children project
childrentochildren networks

Working paper prepared by the Secretariat
contents
General
Montserrat1 is situated in the Leeward Islands in the eastern Caribbean 43 kilometres southwest of Antigua and 64 kilometres northwest of the French Overseas Department of Guadeloupe
the island is 18 kilometres long and 11 kilometres wide and covers an area of 103 square kilometres all of which is volcanic and mountainous
its coastline is rugged and has no allweather harbour2
English is the only language in use by the entire population
the principal religion is Christianity and the main denominations are Anglican Roman Catholic and Methodist
historical background
Montserrat sometimes called the Emerald Island was named after a Spanish monastery by Christopher Columbus on his second trip to the island in 1493
in 1632 the island became a British Colony and its first settlers came mainly from Ireland
Montserrat became a British Crown Colony in 1871
constitutional background
elections are held every five years on the basis of universal adult suffrage
the next elections are due to be held in 2001
during the Governor's absence the Speaker of the Legislative Council acts as Governor
the law of the Territory is English common law together with locally enacted legislation
it is administered by the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court
the force is made up of 51 people of whom only 60 per cent are Montserratian2
political developments
the current Governor of Montserrat Anthony Abbot was sworn in on 17 September 1997 David Brandt has been Chief Minister of Montserrat since August 1997
Montserrat's political party system is not very stable
the main political parties are the Movement for National Reconstruction the People's Progressive Alliance and the National Progressive Party
a new electoral system has been proposed
a commission will be created to determine the voting procedures for the elections to be held in October 2001
the new Assembly however will not include any nominated members
one of the most important issues for the new election will be the question of a qualifying prepoll residence period
the amount of residence time which has been suggested is three weeks which would make it possible for Montserratians who live abroad to return home and vote
neither do we have any hidden agenda to force any Territory to go down the independence route9
status of the Montsoufriere volcano
in July 1998 the administering Power commissioned the Montserrat Volcano Observatory to evaluate the status of the Montsoufriere volcano
in the report it was noted that when the magmatic eruption ended in March 1998 there were no signs that there would be any further eruptions in the near future
this type of activity was cited as being common in volcanoes where eruption was coming to an end
although the activity was expected to diminish over time it was still expected to pose hazards in the southern part of the island
reportedly no one was injured in the latest eruptions
the ashfall covered the entire island and extended to Guadeloupe and Antigua
this new threat came just as the islanders were rebuilding
economic conditions
hurricane damage and volcanic activity have combined to seriously undermine Montserrat's economic development and have implications for its future planning
public finance
CDB is the principal creditor of the Government of Montserrat representing approximately 70 per cent of the Government's annual debt service
the agreement between CDB and the territorial Government provides for moratoriums of varying length on the principal andor interest of 7 of the 12 loans held by the Bank11
the administering Power had offered budgetary aid in the amount of approximately ECdollar 34 million to finance this gap5
in the second quarter of 1999 the central Government's fiscal operations improved in comparison to the same quarter in 1998
the inflation rate increased from 05 per cent in the previous quarter to 06 per cent
price increases were recorded in alcohol and tobacco gas electricity and water and household goods
however there was a decrease in the prices for services and clothing
also income from taxes on income and profits increased by 81 per cent although the revenue from personal taxes decreased
nontax revenue also decreased from 04 per cent to 03 per cent12
banking and finance
liquidity in the commercial banks of Montserrat was relatively high as of the second quarter of 1999
net foreign assets of the banking system increased only by 100 per cent in comparison to 189 per cent in 1998
net foreign assets of the commercial banks however increased by 856 per cent which demonstrates the large amounts of money held in institutions outside Montserrat12
C Tourism
the negative impact of reduced visitor arrivals and spending on the economy has been significant
ferry and helicopter services to Antigua are also currently being provided
economic activity population and employment
at the end of the second quarter of 1999 economic activity was at a low level owing to the damaging effects of volcanic activity
domestic credit was 99 per cent in comparison to 64 per cent in the previous quarter primarily as a result of the decrease in lending to the private sector
however loans granted for personal purposes remained at almost the same at level ECdollar 173 million
in June 1997 the Territory's population had been estimated at 7500
in August 1999 it was estimated at slightly more than 4600
according to press reports the administering Power has announced that it will underwrite the airfare of Montserratians who wish to return from abroad14
unemployment stood at 77 per cent at the end of 1997 and 5 per cent in March 1998
E Agriculture
in 1997 heavy emphasis was placed on acquiring preparing and bringing into production as much suitable land as possible
sustainable Development Plan and Country Policy Plan
in 1999 these plans called for
a Provision of further serviced plots for housing development
b Reorientation of water storage and reticulation systems to supply new customers in the north of the island
C Commencement of withdrawal from services previously provided by the private sector
d Overhaul of fiscal and pricing policies and introduction of strategies to simplify and strengthen collection techniques
E Programmes for potential privatization contracting out and private finance initiatives in operation
F Establishment of internationally competitive clear and nondiscretionary inward investment legislation
H Improvements in the provision of nursery primary and secondary facilities19
social conditions
education
in 1998 there were four government primary schools in operation in the designated safe zone accommodating children from the nonevacuated as well as the evacuated areas
there are two private primary schools one private secondary school and one amalgamated government secondary school with three campuses20
housing and infrastructure development
in support of this project the Government planned to draw down its reserves by ECdollar 15 million in order to help finance additional selfbuild housing
the Ministry of Housing and the Land Development Authority of Montserrat identified 808 families still requiring housing
as of January 2000 only 150 people were housed in emergency accommodations which had been built as a direct result of the volcano eruption
these projects have been undertaken with financial assistance from the United Kingdom21
C Health
according to press reports community health clinics providing free services for Montserratians are in operation in the safe zone at three locations St Peter's Cudjoe Head and St John's
in addition there are two private medical practitioners and one private dental practitioner on the island
in 1998 a new block was added to the hospital facilities in the designated safe zone including two patient wards isolation rooms and a maternity ward
a wing containing a pharmacy laboratory and administrative offices will be completed in mid19995
community
of ongoing concern is the disruption of social ties and communities as a result of the volcanic crisis
according to the Montserrat Sustainable Development Plan completed in November 1998
prior to the volcanic activity social welfare in Montserrat was achieved through a combination of publicly financed initiatives and nonState activities
strong community and family relationships were the basis of a support and assistance network which combined effectively with limited targeted public assistance for the most vulnerable
education and certain health services were provided free at the point of delivery for all Montserratians
the associated breakup of families and communities has also meant that individuals are now much more dependent upon the State than in previous times
E Human rights
as previously reported judicial corporal punishment was abolished in Montserrat as far back as 1991
as explained above with the destruction of Plymouth Montserrat also suffered the destruction of its prison
since then largely ad hoc arrangements have had to be made for the accommodation of prisoners25
according to press reports there are currently facilities to house prisoners for short periods of time
the majority of prisoners with longer sentences are sent to other Overseas Territories administered by the United Kingdom prisoners rarely serve their time in the United Kingdom26
United Kingdom development assistance
we have committed 75 million pounds sterling to Montserrat for the threeyear period 199899200001
this is additional to the 59 million spent in the three years since the volcanic crisis started in 1995
our support finances budgetary aid and the rebuilding of the north of the island where the remaining population live 4500
the costs of supporting evacuees once they arrive in Britain are met by the relevant Home Departments
this formed the basis of the joint Country Policy Plan agreed in January 1999 which includes an indicative investment programme for the period to March 20012
assistance provided by the United Nations and other international organizations
after the first volcanic eruptions in 1995 UNDP provided emergency resources of USdollar 165000 for emergency shelter and housing efforts
for more detailed information about the country cooperation framework see UNDP document DPCCFMOT1
support for the Government's sustainable development strategy will be the ongoing focus of UNDP efforts in the Territory28
the project is being funded both by the Governments of Montserrat and the United Kingdom
participation in regional organizations and arrangements
future status of the Territory
position of the territorial Government
we feel that this is a welcome opportunity for a full review of the constitutional relationship between the United Kingdom and the colony of Montserrat
Government is therefore considering the appointment of a constitutional commission to undertake the review and to make proposals for constitutional change
these proposals would draw on the work of the Electoral Commission which is presently ongoing but would naturally adopt a much wider scope and purpose 31
the Chief Minister of Montserrat expressed his preference for independence within a political union such as the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States
he also stated that selfreliance was more important than independence from the United Kingdom32

agenda item 6b
Rapporteur Ms Uchanya Wichayachakorn Thailand
speakers
Coordinator of the Assistance to the
technical COOPERATION ACTIVITIES CONSIDERATION OF OTHER RELEVANT REPORTS REPORT ON UNCTAD's ASSISTANCE TO THE PALISTINIAN PEOPLE
agenda item 6b
for its consideration of this item the Board had before it the following documentation
report on UNCTAD's assistance to the Palestinian people TDB475
in this respect UNCTAD had met the expectations of the General Assembly and the Conference by providing sustained and concrete assistance to the Palestinian people
UNCTAD's technical assistance activities currently drew upon the range of substantive competencies of the secretariat grouped within four major substantive areas
Working in close consultation with Palestine the secretariat had made a number of proposals for technical assistance which had been positively received by several donors
the structural problems facing the Palestinian economy while not insurmountable spanned a wide range of sectoral and macroeconomic issues and needs
even in the best of political and security circumstances this would continue to engage the special attention of the international community for several years to come
however it was unfortunate that these efforts could be in vain as a result of the war waged by Israel against the Palestinian people in the occupied territory
during the assault of the last two weeks in which tanks and heavy weapons had been used more than 100 Palestinians had been killed and 2000 injured
the continued military siege of Palestinian cities villages and camps also besieged the economy and undermined its development and prosperity
thus Israel had aborted many UNCTAD projects that aimed to provide the foundation for a strong and independent Palestinian economy
if not halted this vicious war would have a negative impact on UNCTAD's projects in the future
the Board's session should have been an occasion on which the secretariat was congratulated on its efforts and engaged in a constructive dialogue
occupation could not provide the conditions for development but rather it increased anger pain and destruction in the occupied homeland
however the recent blow struck by Israel had dashed these hopes
the Bangkok Plan of Action reflected a consensus at UNCTAD for the first time regarding the importance of this programme and calling for it to be intensified
the Palestinian people still had a long way to go in rebuilding and developing their economy and breaking out of their isolation from regional and global trends
the support of UNCTAD and its continued commitment to assisting the Palestinian people would therefore be vital
nevertheless real development could not occur under conditions of military occupation and constant strife
the recent tragic events in the occupied Palestinian territory and the dangers of a wider conflict only served to confirm that belief
in conclusion he expressed sincere appreciation for the significant extrabudgetary support provided for the benefit of the Palestinian people by a number of donor States
the declaration of the recent Millennium Summit of the United Nations stated that no nation should be deprived of its right to development
yet today the Palestinian nation was not only being deprived of that right but was also being subjected to much brutality
UNCTAD's assistance to the Palestinian people was highly appreciated and this was confirmed by the Bangkok Plan of Action which provided further support for this programme
the report also highlighted areas of cooperation between UNCTAD and the Palestinian Authority in regard to which several observations were pertinent
in particular he noted the special circumstances faced by the Palestinian economy which had had to start from a weak position
it was unrealistic to speak of Palestinian trade in such circumstances of isolation and restriction
he appreciated the many technical cooperation projects that the secretariat report had reviewed including studies reports and advice on various issues
there was an organic link between security and peace on the one hand and development on the other
peace was the cornerstone for any development or any future assistance in support of the Palestinian people and the region
she saluted the Palestinian people who once again had shown the world that they would not compromise on their legitimate rights
she thanked the Assistance to Palestinian People Unit for the comprehensive and systematic report on its recent activities
the report showed that the features of Palestinian economic growth that had arisen under occupation still prevailed despite the efforts exerted over the interim period
in this regard she highlighted a number of points mentioned in the report which reflected both longstanding structural problems as well as some recent marginal improvements
while she noted with appreciation the increased support of donors for this programme she was alarmed that a large deficit remained between required expenditures and available resources
the experience gained in recent years had increased the capacity of the secretariat to intensify these efforts a move that she strongly encouraged
this was a source for hope despite the scale of the difficulties the report mentioned
he hoped that the Palestinian economy while still very vulnerable could be restructured and that trade exchanges within the subregion could be developed
it was designed to train people reinforce institutional capacities improve the management of the macro economy develop small and mediumsize enterprises and support trade
in the areas of its competence UNCTAD had initiated assistance that was carefully planned well targeted and demanddriven
such assistance could support the development of the local economy and help the Palestinian Authority to better serve its people
it thus prepared the ground for the peace that he believed was still possible
this deterioration confirmed the fact that there could be no social or economic development under occupation
he was confident that once circumstances again permitted the Palestinian economy would have the potential to develop independently far from Israeli hegemony
the secretariat's programme of activities reflected a sound technical sense and represented a sensitive response to Palestinian development requirements
he appreciated the positive role of donor States so far and he called for additional support for this programme
the representative of China expressed appreciation for the report prepared by the secretariat in an important area of work of UNCTAD
the work of the secretariat over the year had promoted the trade and development of Palestine
UNCTAD's assistance had evolved over the years thus facilitating the process of regional and global integration of the Palestinian economy
UNCTAD's projects were most useful and reflected the longterm efforts that were needed to address chronic problems
he regretted that it had not been possible for a number of projects to commence owing to budgetary limitations
he noted that as recent events had again shown the external environment was responsible for many of the remaining problems facing the Palestinian economy
in concluding he stressed that an independent Palestinian state was necessary to ensure development of the Palestinian economy and the international community must provide the necessary support
the representative of Pakistan said that the discussion on UNCTAD's assistance to the Palestinian people was taking place at a sombre time
the international community again watched with despair and shock the unravelling of painstaking efforts to assist the Palestinian people to embark upon a path of sustained development
in such a situation the specific assistance activities by UNCTAD for the Palestinian people were laudable but their effectiveness and durability were not certain
recent events had borne out the need for a more unflinching assessment of the policy environment in which the Palestinian people sought to advance economically
finally the international community needed to acknowledge the indivisibility of a just peace and meaningful development
the international community needed to recognize that its efforts to assist the Palestinian people would lead nowhere if these efforts took place in an occupieroccupied framework
Israel was committed to reaching a comprehensive peace in the Middle East and had done its utmost to further peace negotiations
this position was fully appreciated by world leaders
the moment of truth had now arrived and it was time for leaders of both parties to make bold and courageous decisions
however the Palestinian side seemed to have chosen another route that of violence
despite repeated calls by Israel a clear unequivocal and authoritative Palestinian statement calling upon the Palestinians to cease hostilities had yet to be heard
he was hopeful that wisdom and caution would prevail and that Israel's neighbours would issue clear instructions to calm the situation down and then return to the negotiating table
however rather than calls for restoring calm just the opposite had been witnessed so far
he went on to state that Israel welcomed the report prepared by the secretariat on this item
Israel strongly supported the strengthening of the Palestinian economy and infrastructure and had been working together with the Palestinians to further this goal
in conclusion he stated that even during the tragic events of the last few days Israel had tried to allow the economic environment to function as normally as possible
the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations and other world leaders were working around the clock in order to get the peace process back on track
the representative of the United States of America said that his delegation associated itself with the supportive comments made on UNCTAD's efforts to assist the Palestinian people
this was an endeavour that had the complete support of the United States of America which had a complementary programme of assistance to the Palestinian people
he also agreed with the statements by the League of Arab States and Egypt to the effect that real lasting peace was necessary for development
the representative of Cuba voiced serious concern about the disparity between events in the occupied Palestinian territory and the picture drawn by the secretariat report
while the report did not give reason for much optimism it showed that UNCTAD and the international community were making efforts for the development of the Palestinian people
there was a contradiction between the contents of the secretariat report and actual events on the ground

fiftyfifth session Agenda item 36 Bethlehem 2000
letter dated 7 September 2000 from the Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People addressed to the SecretaryGeneral
this event is being held in commemoration of the twothousandth anniversary of the birth of Jesus Christ in Bethlehem and the dawning of the third millennium
the years of conflict in the region have made the task of rehabilitating Bethlehem an extremely challenging one
it became obvious that to implement the project successfully and in a timely manner broad and varied international assistance would be required
as a result of increased awareness and worldwide promotion of the project's objectives substantial contributions have already been made by Member States and intergovernmental and civil society organizations
the Palestinian people will require considerable international assistance in order to deal successfully with the enormous rehabilitation and development tasks
donor assistance therefore is vital for the improvement of the economic and social conditions of the Palestinian people and for creating a viable Palestinian economy
I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the General Assembly under agenda item 36

General debate
the President I now give the floor to the Chairman of the delegation of Bahrain His Excellency Mr Jassim Mohammed Buallay
may I also assure you of my delegation's cooperation in achieving the objectives we all desire
may I also extend my delegation's congratulations to the Government and people of Tuvalu on the occasion of its admission to membership in the United Nations
its admission is a further demonstration of the universality of the Organization
the fiftyfifth session is remarkable because it also encompasses the work of the Millennium Summit which was attended by a large number of leaders of Member States
they also identified the changes and challenges that will require joint international cooperation on the basis of the lofty and noble principles and purposes enshrined in the Organization's Charter
this is particularly the case with regard to the ongoing and accelerating revolution in the fields of communications modern technology and economic globalization
in the field of human rights Bahrain continues to take considerable steps by signing a number of international conventions in recognition of the importance of those rights
as a result Bahrain has undertaken ambitious development projects with a view to diversifying the sources of its national income
those projects include an open economic policy that has made Bahrain an advanced regional and global commercial and financial centre
it is unfortunate that internal strife persists in Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as in other areas
we are pleased in this connection to welcome the recent positive developments in Somalia which have led to the election of a President in that country
the misgivings with regard to globalization have been amply discussed and identified
the process of economic globalization and development has given rise to many challenges for the world economy and the international community
the President I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr Borys Tarasyuk Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine
we strongly believe that only the United Nations possesses both the relevant powers and the wide range of tools and mechanisms to address today's major global problems
these problems are the same today as they were several decades ago war poverty inequality in distribution of resources repression and discrimination
Ukraine welcomes the report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations chaired by Ambassador Brahimi
my country finds most of its recommendations substantial and farreaching and calls for their speedy implementation
that is precisely why since 1992 more than 12000 representatives of Ukraine have participated in 20 United Nations peacekeeping operations and missions
in the course of the past eight months alone Ukraine has deployed a contingent of 650 troops with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon UNIFIL
the deployment of a special Ukrainian police unit of 115 servicemen with the United Nations police force in Kosovo is being completed this week
our military contingent earmarked for the United Nations operation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo stands in full operational readiness
regrettably it is common knowledge that human history can be called a chronicle of continuous wars and conflicts
Ukrainian experts stand ready for this work
in our view the concept of regional centres on conflict prevention can become a practical step towards developing a relevant United Nations strategy
my country is keenly following the process of conflict settlement in the neighbouring Balkans the troublesome region of Europe
while developments in Bosnia give us sufficient grounds for optimism about the future of its peoples the situation in Kosovo still causes us serious concern
I once again confirm the invitation by President Kuchma to host in Yalta the next round of negotiations between the Georgian and Abkhaz sides aimed at confidencebuilding
President Kuchma has also presented a feasible plan for the settlement of the Transdniestria conflict based on the principle of acquired status acceptable to all conflicting parties
we very much hope that in the long run these initiatives will reinvigorate the process of resolving the conflict
the credibility of the United Nations will always be measured by its ability to provide an adequate response to threats to peace and security in every region of the world
today this principle should be upheld by giving special attention to the problems of the African continent
the untold sufferings of the peoples of Africa resulting from both intraState and interState conflicts are unlike those in any other part of the globe
Ukraine is determined to make a practical contribution to United Nations peace efforts aimed at resolving conflicts in Africa
this determination is reinforced by our aspiration to expand trade and economic cooperation with our African partners
let me repeat the words of the President of Ukraine at the Security Council Summit
Ukraine looks forward to a century of African renaissance and stands ready to hasten its arrival SPV4194 p 13
this has to be particularly emphasized in relation to the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo the most dangerous challenge to peace at the turn of the century
Ukraine calls on all parties to the Lusaka Agreement to comply fully with the relevant Security Council resolutions and to implement their own commitments
I reiterate our position on the need to continue enhancing the sanctions regime against Angola's rebel group UNITA
we are convinced that reducing UNITA's ability to wage war is an essential prerequisite for restoring peace in Angola
it should also be borne in mind that the sanctions have to be accompanied by greater international efforts to resolve this longlasting conflict
we note with optimism the latest developments in the process of settlement in Somalia
this longsuffering nation is painfully but steadily overcoming the obstacles in its path to peace and stability
over the past year an important step forward was taken in advancing one of the integral parts of the Middle East peace process its IsraeliLebanese component
the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon in compliance with Security Council resolution 425 1978 has created new conditions for further progress in the whole process
we are following closely the process of solving the core issue of the Middle East problem the question of Palestine
it is our firm belief that the political wisdom and farsightedness of the Israelis and Palestinians will eventually help them to reach a mutually acceptable compromise
we welcome the 10September decision by the Palestinian Central Council to postpone the date of proclamation of the State of Palestine
Ukraine hopes that following strenuous efforts on both sides the Palestinian people will finally exercise their right to selfdetermination and to their own statehood
the promotion of disarmament and nuclear nonproliferation are among the crucial issues before the United Nations and the whole international community at the turn of the century
we believe that nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation are the cornerstones of international security and a means of averting a global conflict
it is the nuclear States that should be in the vanguard of this process
the problem of illegal arms trafficking which has acquired a global dimension also requires a universal approach to its solution
the key role of the United Nations is indispensable in consolidating the international efforts to fight this evil
turning now to the problem of the Security Councilimposed sanctions I would like to reaffirm the position of my country on this issue
sanctions were designed as a powerful tool to ensure the implementation of the Council's decisions
however they were eventually turned into ineffective and sometimes even harmful instruments
Ukraine supports the recent Security Council practice of defining time limits of sanctions at the stage of their imposition
we believe that it is of primary importance to develop objective criteria and mechanisms for assessing the effectiveness of sanctions and their impact including on the target State
we also support the immediate lifting of sanctions when there are sufficient grounds to believe that they have served their purpose
among the major challenges of the new century the problem of HIVAIDS occupies a special place
AIDS has become an epidemic of global proportions with enormous human and social ramifications that go far beyond the province of health alone
the time has come for the United Nations to elaborate a comprehensive agenda for action against this pandemic
we are encouraged by the wide support for this idea and look forward to further work towards its realization
we are convinced that the multilateral forms of international cooperation have played and will continue to play a decisive role in the attainment of the goals of sustainable development
during the difficult period of economic transition the assistance to Ukraine by UNDP plays an important role by streamlining the efforts of various international partners
it also helps to alleviate the complex problems related to the elimination of the Chernobyl disaster's consequences and the decommissioning of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant
almost dollar50 million still needs to be raised to reach the amount required and we count on continuing international assistance in this regard
I believe this could be effectuated within the framework of the United Nations Chernobyl programme
in this context we attach great importance to the accession of Ukraine to the World Trade Organization
international economic cooperation at the regional level is also of significance for Ukraine
fulfilling the concept of human rights for all in the next century is a task of global dimension
that is why strengthening and improving the international monitoring of human rights violations becomes particularly acute today
at the same time we remain convinced that the use of force cannot be considered an adequate means of ensuring respect for human rights
I wish to emphasize that adherence to and protection of human rights became the key policy principle of my country
this year Ukraine adopted a decision to abolish capital punishment
the time that has passed since the historic Rome Conference clearly reaffirmed the epochmaking significance of the document it adopted
we consider the International Criminal Court the only viable democratic mechanism of a universal character to enforce compliance with and respect for international humanitarian law
I would like to join previous speakers in expressing our great hopes for the continuing role of the United Nations in bringing solutions to global problems
given the complexity and the multidimensional nature of this task our Organization needs to stand on a solid financial footing
therefore the process of United Nations reform initiated three years ago should get additional impetus
there is also a need to reactivate the efforts aimed at Security Council reform which is the key element within the process of renewing the United Nations
this was rightly emphasized in the statements of many world leaders at the Millennium Summit
the absence of substantive progress on this issue limits the capacities of the Council as the major instrument of collective security
the interests of both developed and developing countries have to be taken into account
Ukraine believes that the necessary balance within an expanded Security Council can be achieved through an increase in both categories of its members
only by intensifying concerted and resolute efforts to attain our determined goals will we realize the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations
after all this is the only raison dêtre for our Organization
the President I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr Vartan Oskanian the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Armenia
Mr Oskanian Armenia Allow me to join my colleagues in congratulating you Sir on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly
I am confident that this fiftyfifth session will be most effective and successful under your guidance
I would also like to express our appreciation to your predecessor Mr Gurirab for his skilful leadership and I welcome Tuvalu to the United Nations as a new Member
all these were clearly reflected in the SecretaryGeneral's report and the Millennium Declaration which provide us with a blueprint for a common agenda in the years to come
this is a global agenda to meet global goals but as is often said all politics is local and everything begins at home
at the same time the revolution in communication and information technologies has opened up the global market to new players
information technology and the Internet have become the moving engines for economic growth and at the same time if used appropriately its great equalizers
Armenia is fully cognizant of this and has made information technology development the axis of its economic growth
by 2005 all our schools will have computer capabilities with unlimited Internet access
freedom from want and freedom from fear go hand in hand
this year with Armenia's membership in the Council of Europe these processes will become irreversible
the responsibilities associated with membership will strengthen and reinforce all that has been achieved to date
economic prosperity also hinges on regional stability
it is apparent that the new environment of coexistence requires new approaches from international organizations
regional and subregional integration has become politically and economically expedient
this is especially true in the Caucasus which is emerging as a region for competing political and economic interests
we look at our security not only in a bilateral but also in the broader regional European context
we are convinced that in the long run our national security must be anchored in regional stability
we are confident that economic cooperation will help us transcend political problems and facilitate the resolution of political issues
a stable and democratic Caucasus is a work in progress
still the promise of democracy in the region must not shroud the fragility of the emergent equilibrium
Armenia intends to expand its cooperation within those organizations and more actively to participate in various regional institutions
these diverse bodies however must not by the uneven or inconsistent application of their principles exacerbate existing regional disparities
Armenia is confident that the Caucasus is in need of a regional system for stability and security and we stand ready to work towards its formation
Armenia has adopted and will abide by its policy of complementarity conducting relations with all countries which have political or economic interests in the Caucasus
however the region continues to remain adversely affected by the lack of formal relations between Armenia and our neighbour Turkey
unfortunately Turkey's response indicated that it continues to let the fear of history limit its freedom to act
however there is no national history in a vacuum
indeed many nations have founded their spiritual and moral resurrection on exorcising their guilt on the search for validation through truth on facing their own past squarely
redemption and reconciliation without truth will remain forever elusive
the Millennium Summit Declaration addressed a topic that is very important in relation to Armenians right to freedom from fear
the Millennium Declaration provided for the right to selfdetermination of peoples who remain under colonial domination and foreign occupation
for a people whose compatriots lay just over the border but out of reach such a divisive act and the ensuing double layer of subjugation was untenable
we will continue to work intensely with the cochairs of the Minsk Group and wish to underscore their contribution to maintaining the ceasefire regime
with equal fervour we are ready to maintain direct contacts with Azerbaijan in order to search for compromise
in his report the SecretaryGeneral rightly stated that today more wars are being fought within States than between them
yet no attempt is being made to address this new challenge in a more effective meaningful and realistic way
if I may be allowed a truism we should think along the lines of form follows function
the political document adopted by the Millennium Summit sets the guidelines for the development of the United Nations in the coming years
Armenia is confident that this Organization given its outstanding role and track record has the capacity to address the new challenges in a most satisfactory manner
the vast experience accumulated over the last five decades can be successfully applied to secure peace and stability all over the world
however in response to today's new challenges and new demands United Nations reforms must be carried through to strengthen this dynamic organization
with the proposed expansion of the Security Council that strategic body will become more representative and its decisions will be endowed with greater authority
may the twentyfirst century be the one that sees all nations united in shared goals and collective action
the President I give the floor to His Excellency Mr Habib Ben Yahia Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tunisia
your great diplomatic experience and your thorough knowledge of international affairs are the best guarantees for the success of this session
while assuring you of the readiness of our delegation to fully cooperate with you we would like to wish you the utmost success as you carry out your responsibilities
in other words we should make this millennium truly a millennium of the common future of mankind
the last decade has shown the magnitude of the means that are required to resolve conflicts and tensions throughout the world
this has generated a weakening of international will when true and direct participation in the quest for solutions to the many conflicts was needed
the United Nations despite its limited resources remains the main actor that can resolve these conflicts
experience has proved that stability and internal harmony within and between countries will not be achieved without national development and interdependent interests
before concluding my comments on the matter of peacekeeping and international security in this new international environment I would like to underline the following
these new missions require greater material and human resources as well as collective efforts
of course this requires a substantial strengthening of United Nations preventive capabilities
we have also observed through our experience in peacekeeping operations that serious problems do exist especially when it comes to delays in reimbursing contributing countries
secondly the role of the Security Council in peacekeeping and international security is crucial and indispensable
it draws its strength from the fact that it is a universal tool and that it embodies international legality
the need to introduce reforms to the Security Council is dictated today by international developments that have taken place since the adoption of the Charter
in this context increasing the number of permanent and nonpermanent members of that body on the basis of equitable geographic distribution is an urgent demand
we would like to stress the need to reach a consensus that would make it possible to increase the number of permanent members
in this regard I would like to recall that Tunisia supports the candidacy of Japan Germany and other countries
it is also necessary to improve the working methods of the Council in order to ensure that its work is marked by transparency and effectiveness
we stress the need for an indepth examination of all aspects of this matter
the question of sanctions is one of the most important issues that United Nations bodies including the Security Council have to face
in cases in which the imposition of sanctions is necessary their duration should be limited
Tunisia has made the AMU a strategic choice
it is constantly working to promote the Union and to strengthen its foundations and structures
achieving a just and lasting peace in the Middle East will also depend on progress on the Syrian track
Israel is called upon to withdraw from the Golan and to comply fully with Security Council resolutions 242 1967 and 338 1973
Israel is also called upon to respect the international borders of Lebanon and to refrain from violating the borders drawn by the United Nations
furthermore exclusion and marginalization in all their aspects undoubtedly lead to extremism and open the way to tension and violence
we know today that the struggle against poverty has assumed considerable importance
furthermore abject poverty is one of the most dangerous sources of conflict and instability
since the change of 7 November 1987 we have introduced fundamental reforms to promote these values
the existence of a national solidarity fund is the best reflection of the importance of this aspect in national life
in this context international partnership is a common denominator that must guide our action in the next millennium
the President I now call on Her Excellency Mrs Lila Ratsifandrihamanana Minister for Foreign Affairs of Madagascar
Mrs Ratsifandrihamanana Madagascar spoke in French I join all those who have welcomed the start of this fiftyfifth session of the General Assembly
we convey our congratulations to the SecretaryGeneral on his efforts he has made
his actions will benefit all the citizens of the world who are all anxious to leave deprivation and poverty behind
the power of the veto which in itself constitutes a nullification of democracy is incompatible with the founding principles of our Organization
we welcome the outcome of the mediation efforts undertaken by President Ismail Omar Guelleh of the Republic of Djibouti
thanks to those efforts Somalia is now beginning to find peace after more than a decade as a nonState
the election by the parliament in Djibouti on 25 August 2000 of Mr Abdikassim Salad Hassan as the new President is a step towards agreement
the desire in recent months for dialogue between the two Koreas is encouraging
we welcome the summit conference held in Pyongyang in June 2000 to discuss peaceful reunification that led to the signing of a joint NorthSouth declaration
the family reunions that took place after half a century of separation were moving and such meetings should be facilitated in the future
on 25 August 1999 Madagascar ratified the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Antipersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction
furthermore our Parliament's ratification process for the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons has begun
we pay tribute to the United Nations peace volunteers who were victims of the recent terrorist act of aggression in West Timor
we underscore the need for a joint strategy to deal with the current wave of violence
we should stress the training equipping and safety of peace volunteers
in this connection the countries concerned and neighbouring States should make their contributions
adopting a comprehensive approach to conflict prevention is necessary because the problem needs to be tackled at the source
in the new millennium let us ensure that children remain at the heart of our collective efforts
gender equality is for us an ongoing challenge
what Africa needs is easier access to care and medications
in this regard legal instruments should be designed and implemented to create parameters for the electronic dissemination of material that poses a threat to morality
Mr Kafando Burkina Faso VicePresident took the Chair
in this context Madagascar adopted a law in 1999 which outlaws paedophilia
Madagascar is also against any use of the research relating to the cloning of human beings
the economic and social difficulties facing my country are made worse by the uncertainty and changes in the international system
we must therefore strengthen international dialogue on the basis of partnership and shared responsibility
we are convinced that the promotion of a culture of peace and of mutual understanding will help bring about a harmonious world
we deplore the glaring inequalities that exist today our peoples are suffering from famine and malnutrition whereas some others are enjoying amazing overproduction
this imbalance does nothing to promote commercial and financial flows
concerning Africa specifically regional and continental integration is vital in order to avoid marginalization
in this respect Madagascar signed the draft Charter of the African Union which is the expression of the rebirth of a responsible sovereign Africa
we have come to this historic session convinced that it will breathe new life into our Organization and provide the basis for a dynamic for peace and cooperation
we have come here because we have confidence in concerted action to meet today's challenges
we have come here because we have hope in a viable future free from need in a world of wellbeing and peace
the Acting President spoke in French I give the floor to The Honourable Lilian Patel Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Malawi
Mrs Patel Malawi At the outset allow me to join other speakers in congratulating Mr Harri Holkeri on his election to preside over the Millennium Assembly
his election to the presidency is a clear reflection of the confidence which the international community has in his great country Finland
he can count on the continued support and cooperation of the Malawi delegation in this momentous task
let me also pay tribute to his predecessor MrTheoBen Gurirab Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Namibia for his highly successful presidency of the fiftyfourth session
less than a fortnight ago our leaders gathered at this very venue to map out the way forward in this millennium
the enthusiasm with which the deliberations were conducted culminated in a highly inspiring outcome document which gives a clear outline of what needs to be done
Malawi welcomes the outcome of the Millennium Summit
at the same time we recognize that the strategic partnership required for the implementation of the outcome document calls for the political commitment of the international community
let us all build on the consensus that emerged from the Millennium Summit
recognition by world leaders of the urgent need to address issues bedevilling humanity today is the first step towards building a prosperous and better tomorrow
a multiplicity of factors are constraining the efforts of the developing countries towards achieving economic development
there is therefore a need for a multidimensional approach in order to address the plight of these countries
such efforts must of necessity be pursued at both the national and international levels
not long ago Malawi joined other members of the international community in welcoming the process of globalization
we joined the chorus in acknowledging the inevitability of the march towards a global village
in our enthusiasm we looked forward to meeting the challenges and taking advantage of the opportunities that globalization was envisaged to offer
today the experience has proved daunting
a number of constraints dog our march towards the global village
along with other subSaharan African countries Malawi has yet to meaningfully enjoy the benefits of modern information technology
we all know that the process of globalization is centred on the swift and accurate flow of information
the interconnectedness which information technology brings about offers the benefits of choice
those who possess the technological capacity are hence ahead of the rest in the march towards the global village
there is need to close the existing digital divide
international trade is critical if the economies of most developing countries are to thrive
Malawi's exportoriented economy is in this regard no exception
with no mineral wealth of significance our economy depends almost solely on the export of primary agricultural products and the importation of manufactured goods
the steadily deteriorating barter terms of trade for the primary products has long been a source of concern to us
as if this were not daunting enough the situation is compounded by the imposition of protectionist measures by countries that offer markets for our exports
a range of nontariff barriers is being subtly put in place rendering it difficult for our products to reach those markets
these protectionist measures run counter to the spirit of free trade which we all profess and which we all believe to be necessary for the growing interdependence among countries
as long as barriers to free trade among countries are erected global integration will face a serious setback
Malawi therefore calls upon the development partners to open up their markets to products from the developing countries
increased market access is one way in which a country like Malawi could be empowered to meaningfully participate in the globalization process
time and again we in the developing countries have expressed serious concern over the existing problem of external debt
debt servicing has compelled our Governments to divert meagre resources from development programmes
as a result basic social services and investment in other infrastructure programmes suffer
we welcome initiatives adopted by the development partners to address the problem of debt
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries HIPC Debt Initiative is among other measures notable
Malawi therefore believes that the only way in which the problem of external debt can meaningfully be addressed is through outright cancellation
we invite our development partners to exercise the political will for debt cancellation
we need to free resources for investment in basic infrastructural services
official development assistance and foreign direct investment are necessary if developing economies like Malawi's are to develop
the general decline in official development assistance flows to the developing countries therefore runs counter to the internationally recognized target
Malawi welcomes the trend towards a rise in foreign direct investment over the past few years
however we observe that in spite of the steady rise the distribution itself has been uneven with subSaharan Africa making no meaningful gains
we hope that efforts will be made to address the disparity
just over 10 years ago the Berlin Wall came tumbling down in a highly symbolic move marking the demise of the cold war
all peaceloving people in the world who wanted humankind to live in dignity welcomed that momentous development
the concept of peace dividend gained currency as the international community welcomed the opportunity to turn swords into plowshares
today's reality has not borne out our expectations
trouble spots both longstanding and emerging ones dot the globe
greed among politicians and the ruthless pursuit of profit by multinational corporations have in a number of cases coalesced to prolong conflict
we have all noted the role that a precious mineral like diamonds can play in unleashing human tragedy
Malawi welcomes the recent adoption by the United Nations Security Council of a resolution that aims at regulating the trade in diamonds especially those acquired illegally
the international community can count on our unflinching cooperation in the implementation of the resolution
we have also noted the untiring efforts of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security
the embarrassment that the peacemakers were subjected to is something that we believe must not be allowed to happen again
in this regard my delegation welcomes the recommendations made in the Brahimi Report
we at the same time join the international community in condemning the recent murder of three United Nations relief workers in West Timor
we call on those responsible to desist from further interfering with the safety and freedom of refugees and humanitarian workers in the region
Malawi recognizes that the United Nations alone cannot provide miracle solutions to conflicts that rage in the various regions
it is largely incumbent upon the primary players to exercise political maturity and restrain their passions
we note that in most conflict areas there exist negotiated frameworks for resolution of the differences
and yet the sheer lack of political commitment has led the parties to wantonly renege on agreements that they so painstakingly negotiated
we therefore call upon all warring parties to respect existing peace agreements and pool their efforts towards nationbuilding
the Government of Malawi welcomes efforts by the United Nations to rid the globe of weapons of mass destruction
Malawi would like to express its readiness to join the international community in the adoption of measures that seek to advance the cause of international peace and security
we waste meagre resources to keep conflict going while in the process sacrificing the welfare of our people
the above factors present a front which impedes economic development in the developing countries especially the least developed among them
investment in basic infrastructure suffers as a result of directly or otherwise an interplay of these forces
as long as the international community holds back the political will needed for decisive action the playing field will remain uneven
as such the developing countries will continue to be marginalized in the march towards the global village
my delegation does not intend to heap all blame on international factors alone
the democratic governance which the ruling United Democratic Front UDF ushered in the country in June 1994 is well on course
the people's confidence in the UDFled government was manifested when they reelected it in the June 1999 general elections
Malawi's commitment to the consolidation of democracy is now irreversible
in November this year the country will take yet another step forward with the conduct of local government elections
we fully recognize the contribution which good governance makes to economic development in a country
in this regard I would like to pay tribute to the United Nations and those development partners who have contributed to our effort towards the promotion of good governance
as the process goes on we shall count on your continued assistance
we in Malawi further recognize the central role that a vibrant private sector plays in economic development
for long the previous government in Malawi neglected the private sector opting instead to boost parastatal enterprises
the new political dispensation has opened up the country to a competitive free market economy
inefficient parastatal organizations are falling into private ownership through a privatization programme
already there are discernible benefits accruing most notably marked improvements in the quality of products and services on the domestic market
the existing political stability and the general warmth of the friendly people of Malawi create an inviting climate to the foreign investor
the Government has in addition adopted measures which are aimed at creating a conducive investment environment
we therefore welcome entrepreneurs to come and sample the market
the face of infrastructure in the countryside where nearly 80 per cent of the country's population resides has been considerably transformed
we therefore thank the World Bank for the support it is extending to the Malawi Social Action Fund which is currently in its second phase
a few years ago the Government established the Ministry of State in the President's Office Responsible for Persons with Disabilities whose impact is beginning to show
our determined efforts to rid the country of excruciating poverty are impeded by the HIVAIDS pandemic
in the last decade the extent of devastation caused by the pandemic in Malawi has been frightening
by targeting the productive age bracket of the population HIVAIDS has clearly begun to reverse the hardwon gains that the nation had made towards the close of the last decade
at the same time we are aware of the advances that the West has to date made in the treatment of HIVAIDS
the prohibitive cost of the drugs precludes developing countries like Malawi from gaining access to them
and yet these are the countries that are in the greatest need of such therapy in view of their high incidence of HIVAIDS
my delegation appreciates the effort of the United Nations through the Joint United Nations Programme on HIVAIDS UNAIDS to deal with the pandemic
we welcome the fact that the Security Council gave centre stage to HIVAIDS issues early this year
we believe that the devastation left by the scourge deserves a high international profile
Malawi further calls on those countries with the capacity to make the necessary arrangements to render the drugs affordable for all those who need them
this calls for political will on the part of all of us
we need to fulfil our shared responsibilities for the benefit of humankind
Malawi welcomes the recent admission of Tuvalu as the 189th Member State of the United Nations
on behalf of my Government and the people of Malawi I extend our support and best wishes to the Government and the people of Tuvalu
time and again Malawi has spoken in favour of granting the Republic of China on Taiwan the role that it deserves in the international community
the hardworking and peaceloving people of Taiwan have clearly demonstrated that they are ready to actively contribute to the goals and ideals for which the United Nations stands
the continued isolation of Taiwan does not bode well for the spirit of globalization which we all acknowledge has to be allinclusive
finally allow me to reaffirm the commitment of the Government of the Republic of Malawi to live up to the obligations enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations
this is the only universal body that is well placed to take us all into the millennium
the Acting President spoke in French The next speaker is His Excellency The Honourable Lakshman Kadirgamar Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka
I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Tuvalu to the membership of the United Nations
the Millennium Summit is over
I fervently hope that its dreams and hopes for a better world will never fade from the hearts and minds of all mankind
her words were these
these are the fundamentals of the United Nations system
and this is as it should be
States are the principal organizational entities into which the peoples of this planet have gathered
the principal overall organizational edifice of the international community is the interStates system
for the entity we know as the State there is no substitute
if States weaken so will this Organization
if States are diminished so will this Organization be diminished
Sri Lanka is deeply committed to the promotion and protection of the human rights of its own people and of all peoples everywhere
it is not a course whose worthiness in practice has as yet been established
indeed most endeavours to overlook or diminish the sovereignty of States have often had disastrous consequences
these are external pressures that raise troubling uncertainties for many States and for developing States in particular that are without the blessings of abundant resources and advanced infrastructures
these are uncertainties that strain the structures of States and could come close to threatening their very existence
this is particularly so in democracies whose very openness makes them most vulnerable and Sri Lanka is a democracy of longstanding and unwavering commitment to democratic fundamentals
each armed conflict is unique each a creature of its own history the nature of each determined by its own surroundings
there is no simplicity of circumstance no uniformity in scenario no easy solution
internal armed conflicts come in many different forms
nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State
traditional police services are inadequate in design in training in equipment and in experience
few States have ready and affordable access to the necessary information or intelligence
few States are able to maintain military infrastructures effective against heavily armed guerrillatype onslaughts and the horrors of terror
such has been the experience of my country
Sri Lanka has for many years had within its territory an armed conflict that has complicated the lives of the entire population of the country
it is a conflict of an extraordinary nature
an internal armed challenge to any State anywhere is a challenge to all States everywhere
democracy will not survive
the magnitude of the collection of funds abroad for terrorist purposes and the extensiveness of the reach of the international networks developed for that purpose boggle the mind
their receipts seem to exceed the receipts of many transnational conglomerates all free of tax
revenues come of course from the customary illegal trade in drugs arms or other merchandise including the smuggling of humans
but there also exists a far more abundant and seemingly limitless reservoir of funds namely expatriates of similar ethnicity settled abroad
I urge that the international community give favourable consideration to that proposal
the practical manner in which the General Assembly could play that role will of course require very careful thought
this is the case most of all when times are hard
the benefits of globalization have bypassed much of the developing world
the poorest among us spanning the continents of Africa Central America and Asia have experienced increasing marginalization
there is little opportunity for developing countries to be formative in the shaping of the world economy for the future in the deliberations that really matter
the developing world needs to be accorded an adequate formative voice in the formulation of a new development chapter for the twentyfirst century
the people of our region are deeply committed to the goals of SAARC
they have been and are forcibly conscripting even 10yearold children boys and girls for battle against the Sri Lankan Army
some of these children have been programmed into suicide bombers
they are forced to wear cyanide capsules round their necks and to bite on them to evade capture
this wretched practice continues unabated
they assured him that they would not recruit any person under the age of 17 and would not send into battle any person below the age of 18
the assurance they gave him has been totally dishonoured
in a poignant answer to a question by an interviewer the Special Representative said this
children who become soldiers lose their innocence
so there are many reasons which facilitate the abuse of children in this way
I thank the Special Representative for having had the courage to speak out on this important issue
to remain silent in the face of such criminality is to encourage and condone it
parents have reported that their children have been recruited
it is a serious problem
according to their report children as young as 10 years are being forcibly conscripted age being no consideration as long as the child was able to carry a gun
in recent days and months the international press has focused sharply on the plight of child soldiers in Sri Lanka
it holds nonState actors also accountable for such crimes and it calls upon State parties to cooperate in preventing and combating such crimes
in our cruel world if anything should stir the conscience of mankind it is surely the plight of these children
no politics cannot divide us on the issue of child soldiers
massive funds are not required to save them
what is required is the will and the commitment to act of those States which are in a position to act
the Winnipeg appeal is addressed to them
the Acting President spoke in French I call on His Excellency Mr Didier Opertti Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay and former President of the General Assembly
we also extend a fraternal welcome to Tuvalu as a new Member of the United Nations
a little over a week ago the United Nations held its Millennium Summit
to be more precise we held our Millennium Summit
the work of the SecretaryGeneral and of the Member States deserves our praise for the result of their efforts was wholly positive
one could say that the General Assembly as a universal and independent body has been entrusted with a mandate by the highest political leaders of the Member States
interpreting and carrying out that mandate is now the main objective of our work in the General Assembly
for that reason the SecretaryGeneral deserves our sincere acknowledgement
we can therefore say that never before have we had more authoritative or exact guidelines
we should then be as careful in identifying those goals as we are in selecting the procedures and determining the time required to achieve them
in any case there are some realities that we cannot and should not evade
new approaches and ideas are needed in the reform of the Council more than in any other problem
the United Nations is now confronted with the worrisome problem of how to achieve its peacekeeping goals with limited resources and inadequate mechanisms
Uruguay since 1952 a traditional contributor to peacekeeping operations is carefully considering the recommendations contained in the Brahimi report many of which we deem worthy of our support
in any event we warmly welcome the initiatives aimed at a more indepth consideration of what has been termed humanitarian intervention
this is also our position on the regular budget
we cannot overemphasize the link between the question of disarmament and that of development financing
inequality poverty and debt in the developing world are problems that have been and continue to be emphasized in the debates of the Millennium Assembly
the second is related to international trade
in this regard the international community is firmly convinced that international trade must be made increasingly open and free
in this way obstacles to trade discriminatory trade policies and protectionism could become factors of political instability at the domestic and international levels
our right to create and produce and our right to offer and sell what is produced
nor can the WTO cannot turn a deaf ear to this call
but the United Nations does not bear sole responsibility in this respect the Member States and Governments do as well
a solid and hopeful future for the international community will depend on our good judgement and integrity
our ability to work within the Organization will determine whether the Millennium Summit that just took place will breathe new life into the United Nations
the Acting President spoke in French The next speaker is His Excellency Mr Clifford Mamba head of the delegation of Swaziland
the Kingdom of Swaziland continues to develop quietly and peacefully according to the wishes of our people
against a backdrop of difficult economic circumstances we have declared the year 2000 our Year of Delivery in a number of key economic social and political areas
in the coming weeks the Commission that is reviewing the national Constitution will complete its work and we look forward to receiving its report
we believe this national exercise will further enhance the unity of the Swazi people and provide the best possible foundation for our continuing peace and stability
on the economic front we continue to make every effort to achieve sustainable growth and to reduce the level of poverty among our people
beginning with this session what remains for all of us now is to see to it that the wishes of the founding fathers of the United Nations are fulfilled
those wishes ambitious as they may be are not unreachable and can be achieved
this session therefore has the task of setting the pace for the dialogue that lies ahead
since the last session of the General Assembly the Organization has held several global conferences
however the implementation of commitments in some cases is regrettably slow
one of the priorities for the United Nations should be an effective integrated and coordinated implementation and followup of all these conferences
the implementation should be further enhanced within the existing machinery of the United Nations through improving its functions
peacebuilding is a prevention task of growing importance
while some progress has been made in resolving some of these conflicts much still needs to be done especially by the parties involved
with regard to the Middle East we are encouraged by the continued efforts by President Clinton and other leaders to bring both Israel and Palestine to the negotiating table
we are hopeful that a longlasting solution which has eluded the region for so long will be found soon
there is now more than ever a pressing need to finally carry out the long overdue substantial reform of the Security Council
the Council must fully recognize the new realities of the global landscape
it must have a more representative composition and above all it must be equipped to react to the crises and conflicts of today
reform must involve enlargement to include both more permanent and nonpermanent members as well as strengthening its decisionmaking powers
we do trust that the ongoing debate in the working group set up for this purpose will continue and that it will yield the muchexpected results
the Kingdom of Swaziland joins others in welcoming the Republic of Tuvalu as a new member of the Organization
the addition of Tuvalu brings closer to fruition the hope of the founding fathers to see a United Nations comprised of all the countries of the world
the United Nations is the only body that deals with all fields of human activity
it has been a catalyst of many initiatives that have improved the lives of peoples across the world
the Kingdom of Swaziland has in the past been in the forefront arguing in favour of the readmission of the Republic of China on Taiwan and our position remains unchanged
there is no alternative to the United Nations
its objectives and values are universal
we must spare no effort in seeing to it that the United Nations continues to meet the current and evolving needs of its entire membership
it must become the core instrument of effective and fair global governance if it is to be completely transformed to be what its founding fathers had envisaged
the Acting President spoke in French I give the floor to His Excellency Mr Mahamat Saleh Annadif Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chad
Mr Annadif Chad spoke in French It was by unanimous vote that our Assembly elected our President to be in charge of our work
his predecessor the Minister for Foreign Affairs of fraternal Namibia very tactfully and effectively guided the work which was entrusted to him during the fiftyfourth session
he is now deserving of our congratulations
last year during a visit to the headquarters of the United Nations Development Programme in New York the President of the Republic of Chad His Excellency Mr Idriss Deby declared
a new world is being built before our very eyes
new standards are being set which are giving lasting shape to the behaviours of individuals and relations among States
new technologies are pressing us forward to even greater progress in those societies which possess them
those which are closed to change are being marginalized since they are incapable of making their ambitions come to life in the context of the new world
this frightening prospect since it is synonymous with being left behind is very real for many developing countries
but I reject this prospect for my country
yes the men and women of Chad are struggling courageously and with resolve to emerge from obscurantism from poverty and from domination
the results of their daily struggle speak for themselves when you look at what has been achieved in the various areas of national life
politically the democratic experiment which began on 1 December 1990 is being further developed and consolidated
thus political pluralism is functioning while respecting diversity on the basis of consensual and participatory democracy
the various fundamental freedoms which underlie and which breathe life into any democratic political system are being fully exercised
in this connection particular attention should be paid to strengthening the role of women in public life as well as the rights of and the protection of children
the next elections will take place in six months
in general the political authorities in Chad are doing all they can to ensure their success
the most recent meetings in Syrte Libya and the various declarations made by Chadian political actors are all encouraging signs that as we would like this attachment is firm
a genuine plan to fight poverty has been created This plan includes the elaboration of a national strategy for the reduction of poverty
part of this struggle against poverty is the struggle that the people of Chad have waged to complete the project for the extraction and export of its oil
here we would like these supporters to know that the Government and people of the Republic of Chad recognize and are grateful for their assistance
Chad nevertheless does not see its development and even less its security and stability in an isolated fashion
therefore Chad is doing everything possible to make its contribution to creating a climate of peace and prosperity in Africa particularly in Central Africa
undoubtedly some hotbeds of tension have been slaked
this is true of the Central African Republic and of the Republic of the Congo which are gradually regaining their stability
but this stability remains fragile
the international community therefore must help these countries to consolidate this peace by actions in support of reconstruction and assistance
two other conflicts unfortunately persist and also dangerously threaten the subregion
in the framework of the United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa the States of this subregion have not remained inactive
they are devoting themselves to exploring ways and means of establishing peace and tranquillity through measures designed first and foremost to create trust among themselves
the first of these steps is the possibility offered by the periodic meetings of the Committee
these provide an opportunity for political dialogue in the interest of preventive diplomacy
for having created this Committee the Security Council is deserving of our gratitude
furthermore structures and mechanisms to promote peace and stability are gradually being established
among others we might note the establishment of an earlywarning mechanism in Libreville and of the subregional centre for human rights and democracy in Yaoundé
in the area of security there is a plan to organize a joint military exercise for the peacekeeping operations of the armed forces of the States of the subregion
in this connection a mission of evaluation visited the countries concerned in July 2000
the initiative is only at the conceptual stage but it is to be hoped that it will take concrete form as soon as possible
I would therefore like to make an appeal to the other partners to join with Canada in order to broaden the scope of these projects to include the entire subregion
instability and insecurity in Central Africa are also among the major causes of refugee flows a phenomenon that has spared no State
aware as we are of the negative effects of this phenomenon member States took this matter up during a conference that was held last August in Bujumbura
the relevant conclusions of this conference deserve to be supported
the political situations in other subregions of the African continent also concern us
certainly there has been a definite improvement with the consolidation of democratic institutions good governance and respect for the fundamental rights of the African people
nevertheless several crises are persisting and must be a subject of concern for the entire international community
thus in West Africa Sierra Leone has not yet achieved peace despite the commitments entered into by the parties to the conflict
likewise we have every confidence in ECOWAS to smooth out the difficulties between Liberia and Guinea
the Government of Chad is very pleased to see that the two parties have finally reached a peace agreement
we encourage them to respect their individual commitments in order to bring lasting peace to this part of the African continent
the international community must help them and encourage them to build further on this initiative in order to reach total and just peace
it is an example that should edify our brothers of the Comoros and Burundi
we should also congratulate the Government of Djibouti for their contribution and devotion to the cause of peace in the subregion
Chad has not lost sight of the crisis situations prevailing in other parts of the world
the parties to the conflict should seize this historic opportunity and as President Clinton said the world should help them to take the risk of embarking on peace
quite clearly any solution should also cover the very pertinent matter of the prisoners from Kuwait and other countries
the Korean peninsula is showing encouraging signs of the two fraternal countries drawing closer to each other
the historic interKorean Summit which took place between the leaders of these countries last June has laid the foundation for trusting relationships that are so central for any dialogue
the international community should encourage both of these countries to press on in order to eventually sign a peace agreement which would pave the way to peaceful coexistence
the interKorean dialogue might also arouse some interest on the part of the Taiwan Strait where tension unfortunately continues to be abnormally high
both parties should show political determination and imagination in exploring ways and means of reducing tension and opening a genuine dialogue
for its part the Government of Chad supports the request by the Republic of China Taiwan to seek membership in the United Nations and its specialized agencies
I could not conclude my remarks without referring to other ills which undermine and sap all the development efforts of countries like mine
these ills include indebtedness protectionist measures in the markets of the northern countries deterioration in the terms of trade and various kinds of trafficking
as if this were not enough another evil which is even more insidious and devastating has made our task even more difficult
the prospects for solution are remote indeed and it is to be feared that this will reduce to nothing our hopes to relieve our peoples of poverty
I refer to the HIVAIDS pandemic which brings death and bereavement to families on a daily basis
not only is it a burden for our meagre financial resources but also on our human resources particularly young people who are the spearhead of our nation
the African Union will create the necessary conditions for genuine partnership in irreversible globalization but a globalization that would not be synonymous with exclusion and the dictatorship of the marketplace
this globalization we believe should be synonymous with sharing and openness
it should have a human face or it will not exist at all
what we are referring to here is the credibility of its decisions which unfortunately have long been used against the weaker with its policy of double standards
the Acting President spoke in French I shall now call on those representatives who wish to speak in exercise of the right of reply

it was suggested that ACC address the followup to the report at its next session in New York following the Millennium Summit
the report of the Task Force will be submitted to ACC at its next session in October 2000
world Health Day
eighty per cent of the world's population has access to only 20 per cent of the world's safe blood supply
despite progress achieved in human health safe blood supply is still out of the reach of millions of people around the world
ACC expressed full support for WHO's efforts to raise awareness on the need for safe blood supplies
presentations on poverty reduction strategies
the demands placed on national and international systems by the new global environment implications of globalization for international economic cooperation and development
consideration of the postSeattle trade issues at the current session needed to be placed in this broader setting
globalization and the United Nations system interrelationships between trade and economic social and environmental dimensions
a group of Executive Heads tasked with addressing interlinkages between trade environment and social dimensions met on the morning of 6 April 2000
the report of the group provided the main basis for the consideration of the topic by ACC
its report highlighted what it described as the globalization of anxiety and fear
anxiety was also generated by rapid change on a global scale
this called for a collective agenda built on the comparative advantages of the various parts of the system deriving from their complementary mandates competencies and programmes
while there may be differences of views and approaches organizations of the system needed to work together in a mutually reinforcing way
in the aftermath of Seattle WTO was working to increase participation and transparency and was seeking resources to improve such participation
the United Nations system needed to show leadership and to promote the core values of an open multilateral free and equitable trading system
this could only be achieved by active engagement to work together on a broad front
the benefits of globalization were widely but unevenly distributed
there was a large group of developing countries particularly in Africa that traded in very few commodities
it was noted that anxiety and fear of globalization was not limited to the poor and the marginalized
it affected individuals families communities and businesses everywhere and has had an impact throughout the whole fabric of society
the creation of employment and decent work remained the best way to address uncertainties and exclusion
free competition should not be based on lowering social conditions
the need to preserve cultural and linguistic diversity was also emphasized
as regards the environmental and social agendas it was emphasized that the WTO dispute settlement mechanisms should not be overloaded
in this regard a better knowledge base was needed to understand the connections between the various dimensions of globalization as a basis for consensus building
ongoing work in the system to develop concrete case studies was relevant in this context and should be actively pursued
Executive Heads emphasized the importance of the role of ACC in promoting a collective response by the system to the challenges of globalization
globalization was more than an economic phenomenon
it had implications ranging from the application of labour standards and human rights to the management of population movements
it posed major challenges from counteracting the spread of diseases to combating the expansion of criminal networks
each organization had its own constituency and individual voice and was mandated to address specific aspects of the issue
in the same context Executive Heads underscored that the greatest challenge remained ending poverty and making it possible for all people to earn a decent living
the key contribution of the United Nations system was to set norms and establish principles
no market could work for the people unless it was underpinned by shared values and practices
the main task for the system was to advance such shared values and norms at the global level
international law and norms must become an integral part of the language of globalization
developing countries and in particular the least developed countries need full trade access
they also need debt relief to grow out of poverty
market access and capacitybuilding are key to ensuring sustainability of growth after debt relief
ACC encouraged the organizations more directly concerned to develop networking arrangements among them to follow up on the present discussion
information technology
in his opening remarks the SecretaryGeneral emphasized that information technology was the key to the future
a group of Executive Heads was established during the session to examine these issues and to report back to the Committee
the organizations of the United Nations system were uniquely placed to assist developing countries leapfrog the digital divide
the group noted at the same time that many developing countries had been successful in tapping information technology for development
the scope for SouthSouth cooperation was thus considerable
the United Nations system could facilitate exchange of experience and lessons learnt and disseminate best practices
Executive Heads agreed that the following ideas and suggestions should be actively pursued
in the same context it urged organizations to contribute actively to the proposed world summit on the information society
C Review of ACC
they thanked the review team for a comprehensive submission and for its timely presentation
discussions revealed broad support for the general thrust of the recommendations of the ACC Review Team
he indicated that he would then arrange for the preparation of an implementation plan taking fully into account all such comments
human immunodeficiency virus acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
it was incumbent on the system to lend full support to these efforts
while Africa is clearly the most affected region Asia the Caribbean and some developed countries have also been heavily impacted
AIDS is a truly global issue it knows no borders and requires global solutions
it affects international cooperation and introduces new threats to human security and human development
ACC welcomed the measures under way in this regard
the need for affordable drugs and equity in treatment was particularly highlighted
Executive Heads reiterated their strong concern over the serious situation of AIDS in Africa
particular reference was made to the worrisome situation developing in South Africa
concern was also expressed about the broad human rights dimensions of HIVAIDS including issues of equal access to care and discrimination
AIDS is also on the agenda of the Development Committee of the World Bank at its spring 2000 session
the impact of HIVAIDS on refugee populations was also addressed
the special challenges posed by HIVAIDS to the education sector were reviewed and discussed
the SecretaryGeneral expressed the hope that the results of the upcoming medical directors meeting would facilitate this process
in addition there was an urgent need to ensure safe blood supplies especially in the most affected countries
in the light of its consideration of the HIVAIDS crisis ACC decided to
a Urge organizations in the United Nations system to support and complement the efforts of the cosponsoring organizations of UNAIDS in particular by
I Considering the most effective way of integrating AIDSrelated issues into their activities in accordance with their mandates
II Bringing these issues to the attention of their respective governing bodies and seeking budgetary allocations as appropriate for action in this area
the Consultative Committee on Programme and Operational Questions was requested to report on the status of implementation of these activities to the ACC at its spring 2001 session
staff security and safety
in her briefing the Deputy SecretaryGeneral observed that United Nations system personnel continue to come under attack almost on a daily basis
however a momentum is building to address the problems of staff security and safety
ACC welcomed the initiatives outlined by the Deputy SecretaryGeneral and expressed appreciation for the increased importance given by Member States to this issue
it also noted that the legal advisers of the system are pursuing their consideration of relevant issues relating to the privileges and immunities of United Nations personnel
Executive Heads agreed with the urgency of securing stable predictable and continuous funding for staff security
the need for additional funds for security training was also stressed
the staff representatives thanked the SecretaryGeneral and members of ACC for the opportunity to share their views on this important issue
reiterating the need for organizations of the system to accord continuing high priority to the issue of staff safety and security ACC
E Called for the expeditious implementation of priority security measures including those relating to field security officers training and communications
F Decided to keep the matter under review and to consider further measures to enhance staff security and safety at its 2000 fall session
world Conference against Racism Racial Discrimination Xenophobia andRelated Intolerance
in the same context the High Commissioner also sought the advice and assistance of ACC members who have organized similar world conferences in the past
ACC invited its members to participate actively in the preparatory process of the World Conference and to contribute fully to ensuring its success
in addition civil society organizations will organize and hold from 22 to 26 May 2001 a Millennium Forum at United Nations Headquarters
it was noted that despite the complexities of the processes steady progress was being made in the preparatory bodies in negotiating the outcomes
a very large number of nongovernmental organizations were participating and organizing parallel events
organizations of the system were encouraged to continue to support the preparatory processes as well as to participate in the activities of the special sessions
ACC urged its members to contribute fully to the special sessions and the review processes of the Economic and Social Council
the Executive Director requested the advice and support of ACC members through inter alia their responses to her note of 24 March 2000
ACC invited its members to actively support these preparatory processes
the Congress adopted the Declaration on Crime and Justice Meeting the Challenges of the Twentyfirst Century
ACC was invited to contribute to sensitizing the international community on the importance of these events
C International Strategy for Disaster Reduction
during the discussions the arrangements being made to organize the first meeting on 27 and 28 April of the interagency task force established under this resolution were welcomed
issues arising from the subsidiary machinery
administrative Committee on Coordination statement on the United Nations 10year programme on girls education
the text of the statement is in annex I of the present report
ACC emphasized the importance of girls education as an essential component for the full realization of rights and for poverty eradication
items arising from the work of the consultative committees
ACC took note of the following items arising from the work of its subsidiary machinery
environmental Management Group
the InterAgency Committee on Sustainable Development at its fifteenth meeting on 24 and 25 January 2000 endorsed the terms of reference of the Environmental Management Group on behalf of ACC
guidelines on human rights and guidance note on capacitybuilding
C Other recommendations of the consultative committees
the documentation before ACC also brought to its attention other recommendations of its consultative committees and of work in progress in these committees as follows
interagency Committee on Women and Gender Equality
the InterAgency Committee on Women and Gender Equality has invited ACC in framing its future work programmes to select genderspecific topics for its consideration on a regular basis
interagency Committee on Sustainable Development
it also underlined the importance of early systemwide preparations for the 10year review of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development
consultative Committee on Programme and Operational Questions
other matters
he stressed the need for the system to learn to take advantage of the positive force of the media
ACC expressed appreciation for the SecretaryGeneral's initiative and encouraged similar measures where relevant within the system
recruitment practices
the SecretaryGeneral referred to a media report drawing attention to the extended period required to recruit staff in the United Nations
he invited Executive Heads to share their experiences in this regard to see how the recruitment process could be expedited and improved systemwide
the SecretaryGeneral stressed the importance of ownership by the system of the activities of the Staff College and urged all United Nations organizations to strengthen their support for its work
funding arrangements are among the issues expected to be covered by the independent evaluation of the United Nations Staff College
d Staffing of the Office for InterAgency Affairs
E Dates for the fall 2000 session of ACC
ACC invited its organizational committee at its meeting immediately following the current session to finalize dates for the ACC fall session in New York
in this context Executive Heads reiterated their wish to set the dates of ACC meetings at least a year in advance
hosting of the spring 2002 session of ACC
ACC thanked FAO for its offer to host the 2002 spring session of ACC
annex
administrative Committee on Coordination statement on the United Nations 10year programme on girls education
in registering this concern the ACC emphasized the role of basic education as a key component of poverty reduction and of human and economic development
ACC acknowledges the importance of the key principles upon which this initiative rests
it is a collaborative effort which the United Nations system is uniquely placed to lead and guide
the approach to education that serves as its technical foundation is consistent with the Jomtien expanded vision and its evolution over the decade since 1990
in fact the substance of girls education is excellent content for these processes
ACC notes the involvement of a wide range of United Nations entities and will put into effect actions that facilitate systemwide participation

nineteenth session 1416 March 2000
transmitted by the Governments of the Netherlands and Ukraine
the delegation is of the opinion that no final decision on this structure should be taken at an earlier stage
in relation to the structure of the Recommendations as proposed by the RussianFederation Ukraine's principal observations are as follows
the need to divide the recommendations into three parts offers grounds for concern
theproposed division of the parts is very unbalanced leaving aside the unequal sizes of the individual parts
part I contains only four sections part II has 16 chapters divided into104sections while part III has only 6 chapters
we suggest a first level of division into chapters only
this would simplify the division of the document itself
the provisions defining the purpose of the recommendations should be made into a separate first section owing to their special importance
in the light of this proposal chapter I could be titled Purpose and classification
a section on Definitions should be introduced into every or almost every chapter to replace or supplement the General sections proposed by the Russian Federation
this is dictated by experience with the review of the individual chapters in the recommendations conducted in Working Party SC3WP3
in chapter 3 Manoeuvrability section 32 should read as follows Methods of conducting tests on vessels and pushed convoys
these observations do not preclude the need for other structural changes in the Recommendations which may emerge during the process of refinement of the document

implementation of an integrated spacebased global natural disaster management system
report of the Secretariat
contents
information submitted by Member States and international organizations on the implementation of an integrated spacebased global natural disaster management system is contained in a separate document AAC105753
information relevant to the use of space technology in disaster management
Earth observation satellites provide an important and unique source of information on issues of social and economic importance in such areas as disaster management
Meteorological and Earth observation satellites provide the data for weather forecasts
the warning that they provide on hurricanes and cyclones has dramatically reduced material and human losses in many countries that are prone to such disasters
United Nations framework for disaster reduction and emergency response
international Strategy for Disaster Reduction
analysis of the trend in major natural disasters occurring between 1950 and 1999 reveals substantial growth in the occurrence of such disasters particularly during the past decade
it was this recognition that led in part to the launch of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction for the period 19901999
the various initiatives promoted during the Decade served to increase awareness of the importance of disasters whether natural or technological
many organizations and numerous countries made joint efforts during the Decade to bring the issue of disaster reduction to the forefront of international debate
although the occurrence of many natural phenomena are referred to as natural disasters human behaviour is the major cause of people's increasing vulnerability to natural hazards
climate change deforestation and shifting demographic trends are evidence of the role of the human factor in creating a predisposition to the increased severity and frequency of disasters
in other words human activities contribute to growing vulnerability increasing the risk that natural phenomena turn into actual disasters
the new vision is to move beyond the protection against hazards to the management of risk
the Strategy is a proactive mechanism aimed at reducing the impact of natural and other hazards on society and the economy
the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction is a global strategy with two institutional arms
the first arm is the InterAgency Task Force for Disaster Reduction introducing a strong call for interagency cooperation and coordination
the work of the Task Force is also being followed by a number of States that have requested to attend the Task Force meetings as observers
the second arm of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction is the secretariat of the Task Force which is based in Geneva
it serves as the focal point within the United Nations for strategies and programmes for natural disaster reduction
the secretariat is a multidisciplinary team that supports the Task Force in which international policy can be made
it is the institutional platform from which programmes can be launched
it does not implement programmes but enables others to implement programmes more effectively
coordination of humanitarian emergency response
the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat was established pursuant to the adoption of the SecretaryGeneral's programme for reform
team members accompanied by a communications expert andor with mobile satellite telecommunications equipment as required can leave within hours
activities within the United Nations system in support of disaster management
interagency Meeting on Outer Space Activities
the Office for Outer Space Affairs serves as its secretariat
at its twentieth session in 2000 the InterAgency Meeting agreed upon the revised structure as contained in its report on that session AAC105727 annex I
current and future plans of spacerelated activities conducted by the agencies in the United Nations system in support of disaster management will be reflected in that section
Office for Outer Space Affairs
the objectives of the workshops are
a To increase the awareness of managers and decision makers involved in disaster management of the potential benefits and the costeffectiveness of using space technologies
b To determine the types of information and communications needed in managing specific disasters and the extent to which they could be met by space technologies
the Workshop was cosponsored by the Government of Chile and the European Space Agency ESA
the report of the Workshop including the results achieved and the plan for followup action will be presented in document AAC105747
similar workshops are being planned for Africa Asia and the Pacific and eastern Europe
Secretariat for the International Strategy Disaster Reduction
the initiatives are designed to complement and not to duplicate the work of the various international organizations active in disaster reduction
information on the work of the secretariat can be found on the Internet httpwwwunisdrorg
the secretariat participated in the United NationsChileEuropean Space Agency Workshop on the Use of Space Technology in Disaster Management held in La Serena Chile in November 2000
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
the operations centre of the Disaster Response Branch is specially designed and equipped for the mobilization and coordination of international emergency operations in response to disasters
first on the Ground initiative
the initiative will be led by the communications company Ericsson with United Nations partners and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
C Disaster Management Support Group of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites
by extending the invitation the Committee recognized the important contributions being made by CEOS on the subject
the membership of CEOS includes Earth observation satellite operators and users of satellite data
a significant number of entities of the UnitedNations system including the Office for Outer Space Affairs are associate members of CEOS
weather satellites have long been used to support forecasting of intense weather hazards such as tropical cyclones severe storms and flash floods
the Project published two annual reports
since the last report was published the Project has become an ad hoc working group of CEOS
the Disaster Management Support Group focuses on developing and refining recommendations for the application of satellite data to selected hazard areas
hazard teams for the selected areas have been formed to document findings recommendations and specific user requirements
meetings of the Disaster Management Support Group have been held 23 times per year
the Disaster Management Support Group currently has eight hazard teams whose members include representatives from satellite agencies and emergency management users organizations
there are hazard teams for drought earthquake fire flood ice landslide oil spill and volcanic hazards
teams are charged with compiling user requirements identifying shortcomings and gaps in the provision of required satellite data and developing recommendations for alleviating them
particular emphasis is placed on working closely with space agencies international and regional organizations and commercial organizations on the implementation of the recommendations
following its formation the Disaster Management Support Group held a planning meeting in Tokyo in February 2000
those representatives described examples of disaster support that could be provided by private satellite operators
participants explored ways to cooperate on providing better information to those who need to obtain remotely sensed data
since then the Canadian Space Agency has also signed the Charter
in general timely information on the development of hazards as well as general information on risks hazards and opportunities remains fragmented and difficult to locate
to address these and other problems prototype tools are being developed
a number of agencies are participating in the development of the server providing links to their data and information
an information tool team oversees the development of the server
the information tool team is currently developing two tools
one is a hot events page of links to web sites with data and products for recent significant hazard events
the other is a contacts page to direct potential users to providers of data and products that can support disaster management
the Disaster Management Support Group has developed a number of findings and recommendations
there are currently 12 overarching recommendations derived from nine findings
the full set of findings and overarching recommendations and hazardspecific team recommendations can be found in the report of the Disaster Management Support Group to CEOS for the year 2000
hazard team reports and the information tool team report are also available via the information server of the Disaster Management Support Group on the Internet httpdisasterceosorg and in hard copy
the work plan of the Disaster Management Support Group calls for hazard teams and the information tool team to continue their respective activities as well as to address new elements
these include fostering more intense cooperation among space agencies with the commercial sector and with international disaster organizations
one aspect of the work plan of the Disaster Management Support Group is to demonstrate how the efforts of space agencies to respond to specific disasters might be coordinated
each hazard team is considering projects that will demonstrate coordination of space agency assets
demonstration activities to be pursued by the Disaster Management Support Group imply no formal commitment to the Charter by agencies that are willing to participate in a demonstration
nevertheless it is expected that several more space agencies will join the Charter
the work plan of the Disaster Management Support Group also envisions greater coordination with other CEOS working groups
global Disaster Information Network
its aim is to make better use of existing and new technologies and negotiate institutional processes to promote global sharing of disaster information between providers and users
the Network represents an attempt to improve the effectiveness and interoperability of natural and technological disaster information systems
it does this in part by providing a primary portal of access and linkage to existing national and international emergency and disaster management networks
the Network fosters better early warning and mitigation and a more informed general public
the Global Disaster Information Network is global in scope
the Network processes information about all disaster management functions prevention mitigation planning preparedness monitoring warning response rehabilitation reconstruction and recovery

third report on State responsibility
by Mr James Crawford Special Rapporteur
addendum
contents
invocation of responsibility by an injured State continued
d Countermeasures by an injured State
the remaining issue concerning invocation of responsibility by an injured State relates to the taking of countermeasures
the outcome of the debate was summarized in the Commission's Report for 1999 as follows
a minority in the Commission preferred retaining the linkage between countermeasures and Part Three
however even they did not defend the inequality that existed in the relationship between the taking of countermeasures and dispute settlement
this view appears to command general support in the Commission at least as a first hypothesis
of these the most obvious would be the further specification of the conditions for countermeasures in Part One chapter V
in particular the Court accepted the conception of countermeasures underlying article 47
at a general level Governments have referred to
the difficulty of distinguishing in practice between countermeasures and interim measures of protection as referred to in article 48 1
the question whether the countermeasures should have some nexus to the breach ie the notion of reciprocal countermeasures
the eventuality of collective measures and of countermeasures in case of breach of multilateral or erga omnes obligations
the impact of the distinction between crimes and delicts on the regime of countermeasures and more generally the question whether countermeasures have a punitive function
the impact of countermeasures on the economic situation of the target State and on human rights in that State as well as possible impacts on third States
the unbalanced nature of countermeasures which favour only the most powerful States
in the Special Rapporteur's view while these criticisms and queries need to be addressed they do not lead to the conclusion that the draft articles should be deleted
in his view countermeasures are properly considered as aspects of the invocation of State responsibility ie as instrumental consequences to adopt the terminology of Mr ArangioRuiz
in addition it may be said that in general the response to the Commission's work on the subject so far has been positive
review of existing chapter III articles 4750
articles 4750 presently form a rather integrated group and it is not possible to deal with issues affecting for example article 47 without considering later articles
a Article 47 Countermeasures by an injured State
article 47 provides
1
the taking of countermeasures is subject to the conditions and restrictions set out in articles 48 to 50
according to the commentary article 47 specifies the entitlement of the injured State to take lawful countermeasures
by contrast the ostensive definition in paragraph 1 refrains from saying that the injured State is entitled to take countermeasures or that they are lawful
it simply says what they are
their unlawfulness is precluded not by article 47 but by virtue of article 30
and the commentary treats them on this footing while at the same time stressing the limitations on their use
according to the commentary this is of particular relevance in cases of possible violation by the injured State of rules setting forth erga omnes obligations
as noted already it is appropriate to consider this situation first before turning to the more complex issues of collective obligations and collective countermeasures
only a few Governments have commented generally on article 47
paragraphs 1 and 3 have given rise to more specific observations
France and Denmark on behalf of the Nordic countries do not question the substance of paragraph 3 but consider that it would be better dealt with in a separate provision
indeed Denmark supports a more general redrafting of article 47 in keeping with a cautious approach aimed at limiting the entitlement of resorting to countermeasures
b Article 48 Conditions relating to resort to countermeasures
article 48 lays down certain procedural conditions for the taking of countermeasures or for their continuation in force
it was by far the most controversial of the four articles adopted on first reading
it provides
1
prior to taking countermeasures an injured State shall fulfil its obligation to negotiate provided for in article 54
the commentary notes a central disagreement within the Commission on article 48
according to the commentary interim measures are those which are necessary to preserve the legal rights of the injured State
but if it does take countermeasures the State against whom they are taken may resort to binding arbitration or to other applicable binding third party settlement of the dispute
the Czech Republic and Ireland note the debate and controversy in the Commission over article 48
Government comments on it equally reflect a broad range of differing sometimes conflicting views
on the one hand Switzerland for example is satisfied with the provisions on the settlement of disputes with respect to countermeasures
other Governments consider that article 48 should be substantially amended if not omitted altogether
apart from these general observations and suggestions government comments mostly focus on paragraphs 1 and 2
two main issues are discussed as far as paragraph 1 is concerned
the first relates to the obligation to negotiate which must be fulfilled prior to the taking of fullscale countermeasures
for the United Kingdom for example paragraph 1 proposes a novel and unjustified restraint upon States which is impractical and utopian in the fastmoving modern world
the second issue raised in respect of paragraph 1 relates to the reference to interim measures of protection
for Argentina interim measures would appear to differ from countermeasures not in their nature but in their degree or duration
the United States considers that the requirement embodied in paragraph 3 may lead to further delay and abuse by the wrongdoing State
C Article 49 Proportionality
article 49 lays down the basic requirement of proportionality as a condition for a legitimate countermeasure
it provides that
countermeasures taken by an injured State shall not be out of proportion to the degree of gravity of the internationally wrongful act and the effects thereof on the injured State
the question is not the existence of the requirement but the rigour with which it is to be applied
the requirement of proportionality is thus flexible allowing to be taken into account both the gravity of the wrongful act and its effects on the injured State
a few express concerns as to the drafting of article 49 but none doubt the relevance of the reference to the degree of gravity of the internationally wrongful act
the question raised by States in respect of article 49 is rather whether the provision should be refined by adding other relevant elements in the determination of proportionality
Austria for example emphasizing the regulating effect provided by the principle of proportionality calls for further refinement of the concept at least in the commentary to the article
two other points are raised with respect to article 49
d Article 50 Prohibited countermeasures
article 50 specifies five categories of conduct which are prohibited as countermeasures
it provides
an injured State shall not resort by way of countermeasures to
a The threat or use of force as prohibited by the Charter of the United Nations
b Extreme economic or political coercion designed to endanger the territorial integrity or political independence of the State which has committed the internationally wrongful act
C Any conduct which infringes the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents premises archives and documents
d Any conduct which derogates from basic human rights or
E Any other conduct in contravention of a peremptory norm of general international law
it goes on to deal in turn with the specific exclusions
the commentary attempts to address the point
rather the question is that of inhumane consequences which are the indirect result of measures aimed at the wrongdoing State
the commentary cites instances of boycotts and other measures which exempt articles intended to relieve human suffering or activities intended for humanitarian assistance
those Governments commenting on article 50 appear rather divided as to its general purpose and content
some Governments on the other hand are of the view that article 50 does not generally reflect State practice or customary international law
opinions as to subparagraph b by contrast are divided
France considers that it has no basis in customary law and should be deleted
Japan fears that it would prohibit virtually all countermeasures
Ireland and Switzerland are more supportive of the subparagraph
moreover it considers that some such limitation on the taking of countermeasures is desirable even if the term extreme lacks precision
few comments have been made as to subparagraph c
the United States is likewise strongly in favour of subparagraph c which however should not be misinterpreted to preclude actions taken on the basis of reciprocity
subparagraph d raises a similar debate as subparagraph b
the United Kingdom finds it also difficult to grasp and unacceptably wide even though it strikes a sympathetic chord
in its opinion subparagraph d raises issues of substantive law and this confirms that no detailed regulation of countermeasures should be attempted in the draft articles
Ireland on the other hand agrees with the general thrust of the limitation for basic human rights
relying in particular on article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights it suggests that the list there laid down be included in draft article 50
as to subparagraph e Ireland suggests that it be deleted
countermeasures shall cease as soon as the obligations breached have been performed and full reparation has been obtained by the injured State
recasting the provisions on countermeasures by an injured State
against this background five basic issues can be identified as follows
a The definition of countermeasures
b Obligations not subject to the regime of countermeasures
C Conditions for taking and maintaining countermeasures
d The termination of countermeasures
E The formulation of article 30
these will be considered in turn
a Definition of countermeasures
it has attracted a significant number of comments and proposals from Governments
underlying these is a concern as to the dual character of the draft articles on countermeasures
but their focus is on the regulation of countermeasures and this corresponds to the focus of much governmental concern viz the possible abuse of countermeasures
paradoxically some of the concerns as to the breadth of permitted countermeasures and as to the hybrid character of article 47 could be addressed by a more forthright formulation
but there are still problems in the underlying conception of countermeasures
two in particular need to be mentioned
the first is the relationship between noncompliance with an obligation and the suspension of that obligation
countermeasures and suspension of obligations especially treaty obligations
by implication the taking of countermeasures is seen as equivalent to the suspension of an obligation
the International Court seems to have given credence to this position in the Case concerning the GabčíkovoNagymaros Project when it said that
the effect of Hungary's conduct was to render impossible the accomplishment of the system of works that the Treaty expressly described as single and indivisible
but it is clear that there is a legal difference between the suspension of a treaty and the refusal whether or not justified to comply with a treaty
countermeasures are no more a ground for the suspension of a treaty than is necessity
scope of countermeasures
according to article 47 countermeasures means that an injured State does not comply with one or more of its obligations towards a State which has committed an internationally wrongful act
even so article 47 embodies an extremely broad formulation of countermeasures
yet it seems difficult to justify such measures as instrumental in ensuring compliance with the secondary obligations of the target State
one way of limiting the breadth of countermeasures initially proposed by Special Rapporteur Riphagen is the notion of reciprocal countermeasures
such countermeasures involved suspension of performance of obligations towards the responsible State if such obligations correspond to or are directly connected with the obligation breached
but there are serious objections to the notion of reciprocal countermeasures as a limiting condition for taking countermeasures
these may be briefly summarized
this conclusion reached by the Commission on first reading does not however end the matter
this leaves open the question whether some further limitation should not be imposed on the scope of countermeasures even if they are not to be strictly reciprocal
in the GabčíkovoNagymaros case the Court asserted that a countermeasure must be reversible
after concluding that the diversion of the Danube carried out by Czechoslovakia was not a lawful countermeasure because it was not proportionate the Court said
but the notion of reversibility can nonetheless stand
the difficulty is how to convey that idea
this will clearly entail that the countermeasure not be such as to preclude the resumption of performance and the commentaries can spell out this requirement in more detail
other aspects of article 47
other aspects of the formulation of article 47 are less controversial
it is evident that countermeasures may only be taken subject to the conditions and restrictions set out in the following articles
no doubt this needs to be said but it does not need a separate paragraph to say it
it is also clear that under the Draft articles countermeasures are intended to have an instrumental not a punitive purpose
they can only be taken in order to induce the responsible State to comply with its obligations of cessation and reparation
the circumstance of necessity justifying countermeasures arises not because of the breach as such but because of the subsequent failure to comply with these obligations
obviously for this failure to be established the responsible State must first have been called on to comply
the Special Rapporteur proposes below a version of article 47 in line with these conclusions
b Obligations not subject to the regime of countermeasures
as it stands article 50 prohibited countermeasures combines a number of quite different prohibitions
some subparagraphs are directed at excluding certain forms of countermeasure altogether subparagraphs a c and e
one at least subparagraph b is directed at the effect of countermeasures providing that they may not involve certain forms of extreme coercion
forcible countermeasures
but there is in any event no basis in modern international law for countermeasures involving the use of force as prohibited by the Charter
the only question then is the formulation of paragraph a
accordingly article 50 a should exclude from the regime of countermeasures the obligations as to the threat or use of force embodied in the Charter of the United Nations
minimum obligations necessary to maintain diplomatic and consular inviolability
a second exclusion contained in paragraph c deals with conduct which infringes the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents premises archives and documents
by contrast with paragraph a the concern here is a functional one
it is not that diplomatic and consular inviolability are peremptory or nonderogable norms
it also seeks to avoid the situation where diplomatic personnel and premises become in effect permanent potential hostages as targets for countermeasures
in this context the remarks of the International Court in the Diplomatic and Consular Personnel case are significant
evidently the Court did not contemplate that a breach of some other international obligation could constitute a justification or excuse for a breach of inviolability
it may be noted that no Government has proposed the deletion of paragraphc
that paragraph should be maintained as it stands
obligations in the field of dispute settlement
another functional necessity in times of conflict between States is to maintain in operation all existing provisions for dispute settlement
however it is desirable to say explicitly in article 50 that an obligation relating to dispute settlement may not be suspended as a countermeasure
obligations under human rights and humanitarian law
paragraph d exempts from the scope of countermeasures any conduct which derogates from basic human rights
in any event the measure itself would not be prohibited in such a case merely its effects visàvis the third party
there may however be a need to reflect in article 50 the basic prohibition of reprisals against individuals which exists in international humanitarian law
a provision modelled on article 60 5 of the Vienna Convention does have a place in the draft articles
the broader issue of countermeasures whose effect is to impair fundamental human rights will be considered below
obligations under other peremptory norms
finally paragraph e prohibits as countermeasures any other conduct in contravention of a peremptory norm of general international law
the real difficulty however is in identifying existing peremptory norms whose application is not already excluded either by the conception of countermeasures itself or by other specific exclusions
there is thus a case for the deletion of paragraph e as unnecessary
for these reasons paragraph e should be retained
no doubt a bilateral or multilateral treaty might renounce the possibility of countermeasures being taken for its breach or in relation to its subject matter
this is the case for example with the European Union treaties which have their own system of enforcement
but this can be achieved by the lex specialis provision currently article 37 and it is sufficient to note the possibility in the commentary to article 50
C Conditions for taking and maintaining countermeasures
article 48 as adopted on first reading deals exclusively with procedural conditions for taking and maintaining countermeasures
for the reasons already given it is necessary to consider both procedural and substantive issues under this rubric
I Substantive conditions
four issues need to be considered here proportionality effect on the rights of third States effect on human rights and situations of extreme coercion
these were covered respectively by articles 49 47 3 50 d and 50 b as adopted on first reading
proportionality
no one doubts that proportionality is a key constraint on the taking of countermeaures and the retention of a separate article dealing with proportionality is widely supported
the question is rather one of its formulation
that positive formulation seems clearly preferable
that is indeed a requirement but it is an aspect of the test of necessity formulated in article 47
proportionality is no doubt linked to necessity in that a clearly disproportionate measure may well be judged not to have been necessary either
effect on third States
article 47 3 makes it clear that countermeasures only justify a breach of international law visàvis the responsible State
by definition their rights ie the performance of obligations by the injured State which are owed to them are unimpaired
this does not mean that third States may not be affected as a consequence of countermeasures
the relative and limited effect of countermeasures which preclude wrongfulness only visàvis the responsible State should be clearly expressed in articles 30 and 47 1
if this is done then strictly speaking the issue whether countermeasures justify breaches of obligations to third States cannot arise
effect on human rights
the position with respect to human rights is at one level the same as the position with respect to the rights of third States
the real problem is a different one
analogies can be drawn from other elements of general international law
situations of extreme coercion
the reference in paragraph b to measures designed to endanger the territorial integrity or political independence of the target State raises analogous questions
then there is the problem that paragraph b only prohibits measures which involve extreme coercion and which are designed to endanger territorial integrity or political independence
this suggests that less extreme measures designed to endanger territorial integrity eg counterintervention or counterinsurgency measures may be lawful
broadcasting even if unlawful is not normally a form of extreme coercion
II Procedural conditions
this does not mean however that the draft articles need make no reference to such forms of dispute settlement as may be applicable to the parties in a given case
the provisions of article 48 and the vigorous debate it has aroused have already been noted
three distinct issues are raised
a The initial requirement of the notification of the dispute
b The relation of the taking of countermeasures to the requirement to negotiate and the compromise provision for interim measures of protection
C The provision for suspension of countermeasures in the event that the dispute is submitted in good faith to third party settlement
but nothing is said as to the way in which these demands should be formulated
as to the second point there is general agreement that the parties to a dispute potentially involving countermeasures should comply with any dispute settlement procedures in force between them
existing article 48 2 which says this should be retained
in that regard the following comments may be offered
in this sense they always have a temporary character
the very brief definition of such measures is also unsatisfactory
rather it would be a recipe for delay and prevarication
furthermore that balance seems to be elegantly struck by the French Government's proposal already referred to
the Special Rapporteur proposes a provision broadly along those lines
in such a case and for so long as the dispute settlement procedure is being implemented in good faith unilateral action would not seem to be justified
article 48 34 which incorporated this principle was not simply an invention of the Commission
it was inspired by the remarks of the Tribunal in the Air Services Arbitration
moreover it has been on the whole accepted by the Governments which commented on article 48
in the Special Rapporteur's view it should be retained
to summarize the conclusions on the three issues identified above it is suggested that the draft articles provide that
d Termination of countermeasures
this is clearly implied by the existing articles but could well be made express
E Formulation of article 30
the remaining question is the formulation of article 30 in Part One
on the assumption that detailed provisions on countermeasures are incorporated in Part 2 bis article 30 can be very simple
it is recommended that it provide
countermeasures and the exception of nonperformance
in his Second Report the Special Rapporteur recommended that a narrow version of the exception of nonperformance exceptio inadimplenti non est inadimplendum be recognized as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness
the proposal received a mixed reception and it was agreed to review it in the light of the reconsideration of the provisions on countermeasures
likewise the views of Governments on the proposal as expressed in the Sixth Committee in 1999 were mixed
the first question is whether the exception of nonperformance is to be considered as a form of countermeasure
normally this will involve performance of the same or a closely related obligation
but in the Special Rapporteur's opinion it is clear that the exception of nonperformance is not to be identified as a countermeasure in the sense of article 47
it is true that State A may withhold performance in order to induce State B to perform
but that is not the point of the exception as it is of countermeasures
moreover there is no requirement of notice or of any attempt to settle the dispute by diplomatic or other means as a condition of continued application of the exception
if the former it can properly be classified as a primary rule and need not be included in the draft articles
but the position with the narrower principle recognized by the Court in Factory at Chorzów Jurisdiction is different
this is but an application of the general principle that a party should not be allowed to reply on the consequences of its own unlawful conduct
whether any specific aspect of that general principle should be included in the draft articles is a matter of judgement
if article 38 is to be retained however it is open to the Commission to take the view that the Factory at Chorzów principle is sufficiently covered
on that basis and in the light of the equivocal response it has received the Special Rapporteur does not press his proposed article 30 bis
conclusions as to countermeasures by an injured State
for these reasons the Special Rapporteur recommends that the following provisions on countermeasures taken by an injured State be incorporated in chapterII of Part Two bis
part Two bis The Implementation of State Responsibility

d Obligations of a humanitarian character precluding any form of reprisals against persons protected therebyor
E Any other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law
article 48 Conditions relating to resort to countermeasures
before taking countermeasures an injured State shall
a Submit a reasoned request to the responsible State calling on it to fulfil its obligations

article 133 paragraph 1 further stipulates that Judges shall be independent and in their administration of justice shall be subject to no authority other than the law
article 142 stipulates that The members of the Supreme Constitutional Court shall be removable from office only in the manner provided by law
article 1
Syria ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1969 since which time it has formed part of the country's domestic legislation
when the Republic's Constitution was drafted in 1973 the legislature showed due regard for the provisions of that Covenant and of other conventions and treaties which it had ratified
accordingly there is no conflict between the articles of the Constitution and the provisions of the Covenant
consequently the phenomenon of discrimination or preference on grounds of race religion or colour is unknown and alien to Syrian society
all citizens regardless of their occupational or social status have a legally guaranteed right to seek legal remedy in respect of any act of injustice committed against them
any violation of the constitutional rights recognized in the Covenant is an offence punishable under the Penal Code
article28 paragraph4 further stipulates that The right of legal remedy defence and appeal shall be guaranteed by law
the provisions of the Syrian Constitution clearly apply to every citizen without distinction on grounds of race colour gender language religion or political opinion
the Social Insurance Act No92 of 1959 likewise places men and women on an equal footing in regard to all insurance benefits
in this regard we also wish to point out that there is nothing to prevent women from occupying ministerial posts
at the present time women hold the ministerial portfolios for culture and higher education
the two cases are different
women are fully entitled to seek to eliminate any obstacles impeding their enjoyment of their rights
in fact one of the tasks of the Women's Federation is to defend women's rights if they are obstructed in any way
articles 4 and 5
accordingly there was a need to promulgate this Act and maintain it in force
all the decisions of the Martial Law Administrator are administrative decisions and as such can be annulled by the administrative courts if they are found to be legally flawed
in fact the administrative courts have annulled a number of decisions taken by the Martial Law Administrator which were challenged by citizens who had suffered prejudice as a result thereof
the Higher State Security Court consists of twodivisions each of which comprises threejudges two of whom are civilians and the third a military judge
the military judges assigned to these courts do not act in any military capacity during the trial proceedings
in fact the penalty for intentional homicide ranges from life imprisonment with hard labour to capital punishment arts533 534 and 535 of the Penal Code
the death penalty is applied in a manner consistent with the provisions of article6 of the Covenant as can be seen from the following
offences committed against persons
article 535 of the Penal Code prescribes the death penalty for homicide if it is committed
a Wilfully
C Against any of the offender's ascendants or descendants
offences committed against public or private property
article 577 of the Penal Code prescribes the death penalty for an act of arson that leads to loss of life in the circumstances specified in articles573 and 574
political offences
a Any Syrian who bears arms against Syria in the ranks of the enemy art263 para1 of the Penal Code
I Any member of the armed forces who refuses to obey an order to attack the enemy or insurgents art112 e of the Code of Military Justice
J Insubordination or rebellion in the face of the enemy art113 para7 of the Code of Military Justice
K Acts of incitement to insubordination under martial law or in wartime art114 para3 of the Code of Military Justice
Q Any member of the armed forces who commits the acts of espionage referred to in articles158 159 and 160 of the Code of Military Justice
T Anyone who joins the Muslim Brotherhood organization art10 of Act No49 of8July1980
the Narcotic Drugs Act No2 of 1993 also makes provision for the death penalty in the following articles
b If mitigating circumstances can be invoked the court may commute the death penalty to life imprisonment
mitigating circumstances are inadmissible in the following circumstances
a Repeated commission of any of the offences referred to in this article or in article40 of this Act
final foreign convictions for similar offences shall constitute evidence of a repeated offence
b Commission of the offence by a civil servant assigned to combat drugrelated offences
C Use of a minor to commit any of the offences referred to in this article
d Commission of any of these offences by a person belonging to working for or collaborating with an international drugsmuggling ring
article40 a
Article40b
the penalty shall be capital punishment in the cases referred to in subparagraphsi to v of paragraph b of the preceding article 39
the death penalty can be imposed only for an offence that was punishable by this penalty at the time of its commission
however the offender benefits from the most lenient legislation even if it is promulgated after his commission of the offence
no penalty that was not prescribed at the time of commission of the offence can be imposed art6 of the Penal Code
no legislation prescribing a heavier penalty can be applied to offences committed before its entry into force art8 of the Penal Code
a death sentence cannot be imposed for offences committed by a person under 18years of age art29a of the Juveniles Act
the law does not specify a maximum age beyond which the death penalty cannot be imposed or carried out
death sentences are not carried out on Fridays Sundays or official or religious holidays art454 para3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
the customary practice is consistent with the provisions of the law in this regard
impaired discretion or mental capacity at the time of commission of an offence constitute grounds for the imposition of a lesser penalty
there is no special law of evidence concerning offences punishable by death
there are numerous instances in which due to doubts concerning the evidence presented in court the Syrian judiciary has acquitted persons of crimes that might have been punishable by death
the death penalty is not carried out on a person sentenced thereto until the Board of Special Pardons consisting of five judges has been consulted
execution of the sentence must also be approved by the President of the Republic in a decree ordering its execution at a specified time and place
this particularity applies only to death sentences other penalties being governed by the general constitutional provisions concerning presumption of innocence until guilt is proven
trials are normally held in the presence of the accused but if he is unable to attend he can be tried inabsentia
under the legal aid system the Bar Association designates a lawyer to defend an accused person at no cost to himself
the Code does not permit the extortion of confessions nor does it allow the accused to testify against himself
he is merely questioned about the events which he is totally free to deny or admit
death sentences are carried out by hanging in the case of ordinary persons or by firing squad in the case of military personnel with the minimum amount of suffering
they are carried out in the prison unless a public execution is ordered by decree
the last death sentence imposed in Syria was handed down on 2August1987 against Samih Fahd Awwad who was found guilty of felonious complicity in the murder of his father
the last judgement confirming a death sentence was handed down on 6June1993 against the same person
the next stage preceding enforcement of the death sentence is approval by the President of the Republic who has the constitutional right to grant a pardon
there is always the possibility of applying for a special pardon or commutation of a death penalty as there are no specific offences which cannot be pardoned
this applies to all cases in which death sentences are imposed
a special pardon can be requested after a death sentence has been imposed until the time when it is carried out
in actual practice this penalty is applied only in very rare cases involving heinous offences the circumstances of which preclude any prospect of the offender's reform Justice 98
article 391 of the Penal Code stipulates as follows
1
if such acts of violence cause sickness or wounds the minimum penalty shall be one year's detention
a number of complaints in this connection have been brought against police officers who have been punished and ordered to pay compensation
the Department of Public Prosecutions then has an obligation to institute public proceedings before the competent judicial body art5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
the Prison Regulations promulgated in Decree No1222 of 1929 as amended set forth the principles governing work in prisons arts93100
article 9
as already indicated freedom is a sacred right guaranteed by the Constitution and the law arts 424 and 425 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
by law no one can be detained without charge since this would constitute the punishable offence of illegal deprivation of liberty
Syrian law ensures the expeditious implementation of measures in the interests of the accused
article 122 sets a deadline of 24 hours for any appeal against a decision to release a suspect
under article 145 the judge to whom the case is referred must decide on the admissibility of the public prosecutor's requests either immediately or within three days
under article 220 courts of conciliation must render judgement during the trial hearing or at the latest at their next session
under article 232 concerning trial procedures for misdemeanours committed in the presence of witnesses the court must sit immediately or at the latest on the following day
article 233 empowers the public prosecutor to summon the witnesses orally in such cases and article 234 does not permit a delay of more than three days
under article 235 if the court believes that the case is not ready for judgement it may postpone the trial until the first feasible date
does anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention have an enforceable right to compensation
the general rule as stipulated in article 164 of the Civil Code is that anyone who causes harm to another has an obligation to pay compensation
the civil obligations in respect of which compensation can be awarded are specified in articles129 to146 of the Penal Code
this legal right can be exercised by any person without distinction as to colour gender race religion language or nationality
this right also applies to any offence committed against the victim
article 10
Syrian law regards the decent treatment of prisoners as an obligation as any abusive or degrading treatment constitutes a legally punishable offence
Article58 of the Penal Code stipulates as follows
1
anyone sentenced to a penalty of deprivation of liberty for not less than threemonths shall receive better treatment in prison as his behaviour improves
the Syrian Prison Regulations guarantee health care for prisoners
the Regulations also lay down rules concerning the treatment of convicted persons which in some respects differs from the treatment of persons held in custody
this is in conformity with the provisions of the Constitution article28 paragraph1 of which stipulates that an accused person is innocent until proved guilty
accordingly accused persons are separated from convicts and are treated in a different manner consistent with their status as unconvicted persons
the Prison Regulations contain an entire section on the need to separate the various categories of detainees and the need to segregate males from females and juveniles from adult inmates
in fact sectionIII of the Syrian Prison Regulations stipulates that segregation is compulsory in all prisons
under article32 all prisons must allocate completely separate cells for men and women in such a way as to prevent any contact between them
segregation in mediumsize prisons
article33 In mediumsize prisons detainees shall be segregated as follows to the extent permitted by the number of cells and guards
segregation in large prisons
article34 In large prisons the following categories shall be segregated as far as possible wherever the number of cells and guards permits
suspects accused persons and persons detained for legal indebtedness insolvency or damages owed in respect of an indecent act who have no criminal record
segregation in the central prison
article35 In the central prison convicts shall be segregated as follows subject to the provisions of article32 paragraph1
persons sentenced to up to threeyears detention
article36 Detainees awaiting transfer and military personnel shall be placed in the category to which they belong
for purposes of the application of articles31 and32 any detainee who has previously served a sentence of not less than onemonth's detention shall be deemed to have a criminal record
article37 Registered prostitutes convicted of a contravention shall be placed in a separate cell in the women's section
article38 All the categories of detainees to which reference is made in articles32 33 34 35 36 and37 shall be segregated in separate dormitories workshops canteens and recreation areas
with regard to the isolation of young prisoners
article 40 Young detainees shall be totally segregated from adult detainees during the day and also at night
measures that must be taken to prevent overcrowding
defendants are treated in a manner conducive to their social rehabilitation and reform
attendance of such tutorials and lectures is compulsory for convicts
suspects accused persons and persons serving a term of detention without labour are not subject to any restriction in this regard
however no detainees are permitted to read books during mealtimes
these workshops are either operated directly by the State or assigned to contractors
work is scheduled in such a way as to ensure that no convict remains idle
work may also be assigned to suspects accused persons and persons detained for legal debtedness insolvency or damages owed in respect of an indecent act if they so request
prison inmates can continue to exercise their craft or profession unless it is incompatible with health order security or the Regulations
in addition to guarding the detainees the guards are also responsible for ensuring the smooth and orderly performance of their work
workers rates of pay must be posted at their places of work
under the terms of article96 half of the amount payable to convicts in respect of their work is retained for them as a reserve until their release
they are entitled to receive seventenths of the wages that they earn and have full disposal of that amount during the period of their detention
they must be transported in vehicles when the distance to be travelled exceeds 10kilometres
the official body employing the prisoners pays a daily wage to each of them
every such body wishing to employ prisoners must submit to the Ministry of Interior an application specifying
a the number of prisoners that it requires
b the means at its disposal to guard them
agreement to employ prisoners in itself implies an undertaking by the official body concerned to observe all the regulations laid down in this regard
a juvenile police force has been established to supervise juveniles and protect them from exposure to the risk of delinquency and the commission of illegal acts
the juvenile's guardian is liable to a fine if the court finds that the juvenile's delinquency is the result of neglect
the purpose of these fines is to encourage parents to assume their educational and social responsibilities towards their children
by law young persons over 7 but under 18 years of age are entitled to special treatment insofar as they are subject only to remedial reform measures
the rehabilitation and social reintegration of juveniles are ensured through the social care that they receive from the time of their admission to the reform institution
in addition to theoretical education vocational training is provided for socioeconomic purposes in the crafts for which facilities are available at these institutions
a national fund has also been established to find employment for juvenile delinquents and improve occupational attitudes towards them
article 11
article 12
in Syria no laws or measures restrict the liberty of movement or choice of residence of citizens
legislative Decree No 29 of 1970 regulates the right of foreigners to enter reside in and leave the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic
it stipulates that entry into and departure from the country are permitted only to holders of a passport that meets the following conditions

with respect to article 12 paragraph 2 of the Covenant article 33 paragraph 1 of the Syrian Constitution stipulates that a citizen may not be expelled from the homeland
previously exit visas had to be obtained by nationals each time they wished to leave the country while passports were valid for two years
such visas are now valid for one year and for a number of journeys

the rights and freedoms of all persons are guaranteed by the honour conscience and impartiality of the judges
Syria does not apply the jury system

article463 of the same Code prescribes a penalty of detention for a term of onemonth to oneyear for
a Any person who disrupts or uses acts of violence or threats to impede the practice of any religious rites celebrations or associated observances
it is evident that article35 of the Constitution guarantees the application of the principle of nondiscrimination on religious grounds since it does not refer to any particular religion
there is no religious discrimination in regard to citizenship since the religion of Syrian citizens is not specified on their identity cards
the law does not prohibit any religious community from exercising its own cultural rights manifesting its religion or using its language
this is in keeping with the religious pluralism of Syrian society although the Constitution stipulates that the religion of the President of the Republic must be Islam
in fact Syrians are free to engage or refrain from engaging in their religious observances since there is no authority empowered to compel them to perform such observances
this applies to all the religious communities
consequently the freedom of belief thought conscience and religion of all citizens of the Syrian Arab Republic is safeguarded in law and in practice
in fact in addition to supporting religious and moral education at all educational stages the State guarantees the right of every religious community to receive religious education
as already indicated article35 paragraph1 of the Constitution confirms that freedom of belief is inviolable
in Syria freedom of expression is safeguarded and conscience constitutes the only form of censorship of freedom of thought
every citizen has the right to participate in political economic social and cultural life art26 of the Constitution since Syria has a press association known as the Journalists Federation
freedom of the press is part of the freedom of the nation and its popular forces

a Anyone who contravenes measures taken by the State to preserve its neutrality in time of war
